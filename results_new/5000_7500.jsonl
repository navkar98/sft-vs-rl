Let's start by trying to add or multiply the numbers to reach 67.\n2. Adding 13 and 5 gives us 18, which is far from 67.\n3. Multiplying 13 and 5 gives us 65, which is close to 67 but we need to add 2 to make it 67.\n4. We can use the remaining number 49 in a way that it doesn't significantly increase the value too much.

We can achieve this by using 49 and 5 in a division operation that results in 9.8, and then subtracting 3.2 from 65 to get 61.8, and then adding 5.2 to make it 67.\n6.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we should consider if there's a way to use 28 directly. If we use 28, we need to find a way to get 19 from the remaining numbers (78 and 3) because 28 + 19 = 47.\n2. With 78 and 3, we can subtract 3 from 78 to get 75. Then, we need to find a way to get from 75 to 19. This can be done by 75 - 56. But 56 is not a direct combination of 78 and 3.\n3. Let's try another approach. We can use 78 and 3 to get a number close to 19 when subtracted or divided from 78.\n4. If we subtract 3 from 78, we get 75. We need 28 to reach 47, so we can do 75 - 28 = 47, but we can't use 28 again.\n5. Instead, we can use 78 - 32 to get 46, and then add 1 to reach 47. But we don't have a 32 directly.\n6. Another approach is to use multiplication. If we multiply 3 by a number close to 15 (since 28 + 15 = 43 and we need 4 to reach 47), we can use 3 * 15 = 45. Then, we need 2 more, which is 28 - 26. But 26 is not directly from 78.\n7. The correct approach seems to be combining subtraction and addition. We can subtract 3 from 78 to get 75, and then subtract 28 to get 47.\n\nThus, the equation is 78 - 3 - 28 = 47.\n</think>\n<answer> 78 - 3 - 28 </answer>"}]

The only combination that seems to work is using 46 - 11 + 6:\n   - 46 - 11 + 6 = 35 + 6 = 41 (not 63)\n6. Another combination to try:\n   - (46 + 6) / 11 = 52 / 11 (not an integer and not 63)\n7. The correct combination is:\n   - (46 - 11) + 6 * 10 = 35 + 60 = 95 (too high)\n8. The correct combination is:\n   - (46 + 11) - 6 = 57 - 6 = 51 (not 63)\n9. The correct combination is:\n   - (46 + 11) + 6 = 57 + 6 = 63\n\nThe equation (46 + 11) + 6 equals 63.\n</think>\n<answer> (46 + 11) + 6 </answer>"}]

If I subtract 40 from 93, I get 53, which is not 72.\n\nNow considering multiplication and division:\n1. 19 * 40 = 760, which is far from 72.\n2. 19 * 93 = 1767, which is not 72.\n3. 40 * 93 = 3720, which is not 72.\n4. 19 / 40 = 0.475, which is not 72.\n5. 19 / 93 = 0.2043, which is not 72.\n6. 40 / 93 = 0.429, which is not 72.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is to use division and subtraction:\n93 - (40 / 19) = 93 - 2.1052631578947368 \u2248 90.89473684210526\n\nThis is not 72.

Let's try another combination:\n93 - (19 * (40 - 93)) = 93 - (19 * -53) = 93 + 1007 = 1000\n\nThis is also not 72. The correct approach is:\n40 - 19 + (93 - 40) = 21 + 53 = 74\n\nThis is very close but not correct. The correct solution is:\n93 - (40 - 19) = 93 - 21 = 72\n\nSo, the equation is 93 - (40 - 19) = 72.\n</think>\n<answer> 93 - (40 - 19) </answer>"}]

Each number can only be used once. Let's look at the possible operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nFirst, I notice that 91 and 91 are the same, so we can't use them in the same equation. This means we need to use the 34 and one of the 91s in a way that the other 91 doesn't appear in the equation.\n\nSince 34 is a relatively small number, and we have 91 as a much larger number, it's more likely to use subtraction or division to reduce the larger number to 34.\n\nIf we try 91 - 34, we get 57, which is not 34. So, we should consider division or using the numbers in a different combination.\n\nLet's try division: 91 / (some number) = 34. To find the divisor, we need to calculate 91 / 34, which is approximately 2.677, which is not an integer. So, we need to find a way to get an integer result.\n\nNow, let's try a combination involving 34: 91 - 34 = 57, and then we need to find a way to get 34 from 57. We can try 57 / some number = 34. To find the divisor, we calculate 57 / 34, which is approximately 1.676, which is not an integer.\n\nSince both direct and indirect subtraction and division didn't work, let's try another approach. We can use the fact that 91 - 34 = 57 and then see if we can manipulate 57 to get 34. One way is to use subtraction: 57 - 23 = 34, but we don't have a 23.\n\nAnother way is to use the fact that 91 - 34 = 57 and then use division: 57 / 1.7 = 34, but 1.7 is not a whole number.\n\nThe only way to use all numbers and get 34 is by recognizing that we can use 91 - 34 = 57 and then subtract 23, which is essentially 91 - 34 - 23 + 23 = 91 - 57 = 34. But since we can only use each number once, we need to find a way to express 23 using 91 and 34.\n\nWe can use 91 - 34 - (91 - 57) = 91 - 34 - 34 = 91 - 68 = 23, but this is not efficient.\n\nThe most efficient way is to use 91 - 34 - (91 - 57) = 91 - 34 - 34 = 91 - 68 = 23, but this is not efficient.\n\nThe correct and efficient way is to use 91 - (91 - 34) = 91 - 57 = 34.\n\n<answer> 91 - (91 - 34) </answer>"}]

This is quite far from 74, so let's try a different approach.\n\nNext, let's try subtracting 14 from 36 and 24. If we subtract 14 from 36, we get 22. If we subtract 14 from 24, we get 10.

None of these are close to 74.\n\nGiven that addition, subtraction, and multiplication didn't seem to work, let's try division.

We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to achieve the target.\n\nOne way to approach this could be to subtract a number from another and then adjust with the third number. Let's try subtracting 19 from 63, which gives 44. Then, we need to add or subtract 21 to get 61. \n\n63 - 19 = 44\n\nNow, we need to get from 44 to 61 by adding or subtracting 21.

We can get -17 by subtracting 21 from 34 (since 34 - 21 = 13, but we need -17, so we reverse the operation).\n\nSo, we can adjust by finding a way to get 34 from the numbers we have. We can get 34 by adding 19 and 15, but we don't have 15. However, we can use 21 and subtract 6 to get 15, but we don't have 6.

But since we only have the numbers 19, 21, and 63, we can directly use 63 - 19 - 21 + 10 as a simplified form.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more direct way to achieve this is to use the numbers directly:\n63 - 21 + 19 = 61\n\nSo, the equation is 63 - 21 + 19 = 61.</think> <answer>63 - 21 + 19</answer>"}]

Then, we need to get to 66 using 10, and division might help here.\n\nSo, we could do (92 - 36) / 10 + (some number) = 66, but that doesn't seem to work directly.

Then, multiplying by 1.17857 (which is 10/8.5) would get us close, but we need an integer solution.\n\nA simpler approach is to use subtraction and addition. If we subtract 36 from 92, we get 56. Then, adding 10 and subtracting 2 would give us 64, but we need 66. Instead, we can add 10 and subtract 4, which can be achieved by subtracting 36 and 2 (which is part of 36).\n\nSo, the equation could be: 92 - 36 + 10 - 2 = 66.

So, we need to subtract 1 from 48 to get 47. This can be achieved by using the number 1 in our set.\n\nSo, we can form the equation as 24 * 2 - 1 = 47.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 24 * 2 - 1 </answer>"}]

(82 - 70) + (55 / 19) = 12 + 2.89473684210526 = 14.8947368421053\n20. (70 - 55) + (82 / 19) = 15 + 4.31578947368421 = 19.3157894736842\n21. (55 - 19) + (82 / 70) = 36 + 1.17142857142857 = 37.1714285714286\n\nFinally, the correct combination is:\n\n22.

I can use subtraction:\n40 - 10 = 30 (still too high)\n40 - 8 = 32 (still too high)\n\nThe only way to reduce 40 to 15 using 10 and 8 is to divide by 8 and then subtract from 40:\n(40 / 8) - 10 = 5 - 10 = -5 (too low)\n\nNow, I need to use 49 in a way that reduces the value to 15:\n(49 - 8) / 8 = 41 / 8 = 5.125 (too high)\n\nFinally, I can use 10 and 8 in a way that reduces 49 to 15:\n(49 - 10) / 8 = 39 / 8 = 4.875 (close, but not enough)\n\nThe only way to get 15 is to use 89 and 10 in a way that reduces their value:\n(89 / 8) - 10 = 11.125 - 10 = 1.125 (too low)\n\nNow, I can use 8 and 49 in a way that reduces their value to 15:\n(49 - 8) / 10 = 41 / 10 = 4.1 (too low)\n\nThe only way to get 15 is to use 89 and 10 in a way that reduces their value significantly:\n(89 - 10) / 8 = 79 / 8 = 9.875 (close, but not enough)\n\nFinally, I can use 89 and 10 in a way that reduces their value to 15:\n(89 - 49) / 10 = 40 / 10 = 4 (too low)\n\nThe only way to get 15 is to use 89 and 10 in a way that reduces their value significantly:\n(89 - 10) / 8 = 79 / 8 = 9.875 (close, but not enough)\n\nAfter trying all combinations, the correct equation is:\n(89 - 49) / 8 + 10 = 15\n</think>\n<answer>(89 - 49) / 8 + 10</answer>"}]

We have 43, 44, 47, and 32. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using the arithmetic operations provided.\n\n1. Trying to add or subtract small numbers to get to 48 from the larger numbers might be difficult, so let's consider multiplication or division.\n2. If we try to multiply or divide 47 (one of the largest numbers), it's not likely to easily reach 48.\n3. Multiplying 44 by 1.09 would give us 48. However, we can't use 1.09 as it's not one of the numbers provided.\n4. Considering the remaining numbers, 43 and 32, we can't directly use them to reach 48 through simple additions or subtractions.\n5. We need to use division, as it can reduce a larger number to a smaller one, closer to 48.\n6. If we divide 47 by 43, we get approximately 1.093, which isn't useful.\n7. If we divide 44 by 43, we get approximately 1.023, which is closer but still not useful.\n8. Now, let's consider (47 - 44) which equals 3. Multiplying 32 by 3 gives us 96, which is too high.\n9. Let's try (47 - 44) * 32, which equals 96, still too high.\n10. Let's try (47 - 44) * (32 / 43), which simplifies to 3 * (32 / 43), but 32 / 43 is not an integer.\n11. Finally, let's try (44 - 32) * 47, which equals 2 * 47 = 94, still too high.\n12. Let's try (44 - 32) * 43, which equals 2 * 43 = 86, still too high.\n13. Let's try (47 - 44) * 32, which equals 3 * 32 = 96, still too high.\n14. Let's try (47 - 43) * 32, which equals 4 * 32 = 128, still too high.\n15.

So, we need to find a way to get -32 using 9 and 41.\nUsing 9 and 41, we can try:\n- 41 - 9 = 32\n- We need -32, so we can use the negative of this: -(41 - 9) = -32\n\nNow, we have:\n87 - (41 - 9) = 55\n\nLet's check this:\n87 - 32 = 55\n\nThis is correct. Therefore, the equation is:\n87 - (41 - 9) = 55\n</think>\n\n<answer> 87 - (41 - 9) </answer>"}]

Let's try to use 70 and 28 in a subtraction or addition with 40.\n\nIf we add 70 and 28, we get 98. Now, we need to find a way to get from 98 to 82 by using 40. We can subtract 40 from 98 to get 58, which is not what we want. Instead, we should consider the possibility of subtracting 40 from 98.\n\n98 - 40 = 58, which is still not 82. \n\nLet's try another approach: we can subtract 40 from the sum of 70 and 28.\n\n(70 + 28) - 40 = 98 - 40 = 58, which is still not 82.\n\nSince direct addition or subtraction is not working, let's consider multiplication or division.

We can then add or subtract 70 to get close to 17.\n- 70 - 4.8 = 65.2, which is too high.\n- 70 - 4.8 + 72 = 140.8, which is even higher.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n- 72 - 70 = 2\n- 2 * 15 = 30\n- 30 - 13 = 17, but we don't have 13. We need to use the numbers we have.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- 72 - 55 = 17, but we don't have 55.\n- 72 - 70 + 15 = 17\n\nThis works, so the equation is 72 - 70 + 15 = 17.\n</think>\n<answer> 72 - 70 + 15 </answer>"}]

Let's consider the possible operations and how they might fit together.\n\nOne approach is to look for a way to use the larger numbers (85 and 34) to get close to 95 and then adjust with the smaller numbers (23 and 1).\n\nThe equation could look something like: 85 + 34 - 23 + 1\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Add 34 to get 119\n3. Subtract 23 to get 96\n4. Add 1 to get 97\n\nThis is close but not quite 95. We need to adjust our approach slightly. Another try could be to use multiplication or division to get closer to 95.\n\nAnother approach could be: (85 + 34) - 23 + 1\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Add 34 to get 119\n3. Subtract 23 to get 96\n4. Add 1 to get 97\n\nThis is still not correct. We need to refine the equation.\n\nAnother approach to consider is: (85 - 23) * (34 / 1)\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Subtract 23 to get 62\n3. Divide 34 by 1 to get 34\n4. Multiply 62 by 34 to get 2108\n\nThis is too large. We need to use the numbers more carefully.\n\nAnother approach to consider is: (85 - 1) * (34 / 23)\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Subtract 1 to get 84\n3. Divide 34 by 23 to get approximately 1.478\n4. Multiply 84 by 1.478 to get approximately 124.872\n\nThis is not correct either. Let's try one more approach.\n\nFinally, let's consider: (85 + 34) - (23 + 1)\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Add 34 to get 119\n3. Add 23 to get 46\n4. Add 1 to get 47\n5. Subtract 47 from 119 to get 72\n\nThis is not correct. Let's try the original approach but with a slight adjustment.\n\nThe correct approach is: (85 - 23) + (34 - 1)\n\nLet's break this down:\n1. Start with 85\n2. Subtract 23 to get 62\n3. Subtract 1 from 34 to get 33\n4. Add 62 and 33 to get 95\n\nThis is correct.

This is closer to 33, but we still need to use 61 or 77.\n\nLet's try using 61 and 21 in a more complex operation:\n\n- (61 - 21) = 40. Now, we need to get 7 to reach 33. We can use 4 for this: 40 - 7 = 33. But 7 is not in our list.\n\n- Now, let's try 77 and 4: (77 - 4) = 73. We need to reduce this to 33, and we can use 21: 73 - 42 = 31. But 42 is not in our list.\n\n- Let's try another combination: (77 - 61) = 16. Now we need to add 17 to get 33. We can use 4 and 21 to get 25, but we need 17.\n\n- Finally, let's try dividing: (77 / 21) is not an integer. (61 / 21) is not an integer. (4 / 21) is not an integer.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, we can see that:\n77 - 61 = 16\n16 - 4 = 12\n12 + 21 = 33\n\nSo, the correct equation is 77 - 61 + 21 - 4 = 33.\n</think>\n<answer> (77 - 61) + 21 - 4 </answer>"}]

Instead, we can consider using division or subtraction to make the equation more interesting.\n\nLet's try:\n- 71 + 8 = 79 (too high)\n- 71 - 8 = 63 (too low)\n- We need to find a way to use 2 in a useful manner.\n\nConsidering 2 as a fraction or a divisor might work:\n- If we divide 8 by 2, we get 4.\n- Then, we add 71 and 4 to get 75, which is close but not exactly 77.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n- If we subtract 2 from 8, we get 6.\n- Then, we add 71 and 6 to get 77.\n\nThus, the equation would be 71 + (8 - 2).\n\n<answer> 71 + (8 - 2) </answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. If we start with 89 - 86, we get 3, but we still need to reach 36, which means we need to multiply by 12. However, 3 * 12 = 36, but 89 - 86 is not a valid number to use in the equation as it results in 3, not 89.\n\n2. Another approach could be to divide, but the only possible division would be 89 / 86, which is less than 1 and doesn't help reach 36. Also, 12 / 89 and 12 / 86 are not valid as they result in fractions.\n\n3. Let's consider multiplication: If we take 89 - 86 = 3, and then 3 * 12, we indeed get 36, but we are using the numbers in a way that doesn't directly involve all three numbers.\n\n4. Another option is to use subtraction and addition: 89 - 12 = 77, and 77 - 41 = 36, but 41 is not one of our numbers.\n\n5. Finally, we can use division in a way that involves all numbers: 89 - 86 = 3, and 12 / 3 = 4, but we need to reach 36, so we can combine this with 86 - 4 = 82, which is close but not 36.\n\n6. The correct approach is to use 89 - 86 = 3, and then 12 / 3 = 4, and finally 86 - 4 = 82, but this is still not 36.\n\n7. The proper combination is: (89 - 86) * 12 = 3 * 12 = 36. This uses all three numbers and the operations correctly.\n\nSo, the equation that uses the numbers 12, 86, and 89 to equal 36 is (89 - 86) * 12.\n\nanswer: <answer> (89 - 86) * 12 </answer>"}]

We need to use each number exactly once and we can use +, -, *, /.\n\nConsidering these constraints, let's try to form 15:\n\n- If we try to use 68, it's too large and subtracting from it would make the result too small. \n- Multiplying any of the numbers by 15 would result in a number much larger than any of our given numbers.\n- Dividing 15 by any of our numbers would give us a fraction, which isn't possible with the other numbers.\n\nTherefore, we should focus on subtraction and addition:\n\n- 68 - 43 = 25 (too large)\n- 43 - 40 = 3 (too small)\n- 68 - 40 = 28 (too large)\n\nNow, let's try combining the results:\n\n- If we subtract 40 from 43, we get 3. \n- If we then add 12 to 3, we get 15.\n\nHowever, we don't have a 12, but we can get 12 by 43 - 31.

To achieve the result of 32, we can add 7 to 6 and then subtract that from 31. This gives us the equation: 31 - (7 + 6) = 31 - 13 = 18. However, this does not give us the desired result. We need to re-evaluate the operations to get the correct answer. \n\nThe key here is to use the number 31 as the base and then adjust using the other two numbers. By adding 7 and 6, we get 13. If we add 13 to 31, we get 44. This is close but not the desired number. \n\nLooking at the numbers, we can see that 31 is very close to 32, and we only need to add 1 to get there. Since we can only use each number once and we have 7 and 6, we can use them in a way that adds up to 1. \n\nBy subtracting 6 from 7, we get 1.

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. If we subtract 45 from 72, we get 27. Then we need to manipulate 77 to reach 50.\n2. If we add 72 and 45, we get 117, which is too high.\n3. If we multiply 77 and 45, we get 3465, which is far too high.\n4. If we divide 77 by 45, we get approximately 1.71, which is too low.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's try a combination involving subtraction and addition:\n- We can start by subtracting 45 from 77, which gives us 32.\n- Then we need to find a way to get from 32 to 50 using 72.\n- If we add 72 to 32, we get 104, which is too high.\n- Instead, if we subtract 24 from 72, we get 48, which is close to 50.\n\nNow, let's see if we can use 32 to get 24:\n- If we subtract 8 from 32, we get 24.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n77 - 45 = 32\n72 - 8 = 64 (but we need 48, so we modify it to 72 - 24)\n\nThus, the correct combination is:\n77 - 45 + (72 - 45) / 9 = 50\n\nHowever, we need to ensure each number is used only once, and the division by 9 is not directly used in the problem setup. Let's simplify it:\n77 - 45 + 27 = 59 (which is incorrect)\n72 - 45 = 27\n77 - 27 = 50\n\nSo, the correct equation is:\n77 - (72 - 45) = 50\n\nLet's verify:\n77 - 27 = 50\n\nThis satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n</think>\n<answer> 77 - (72 - 45) </answer>"}]

We can get 5 by subtracting 79 - 74, but 74 is not in our list.\n- Another way is to use 79 - 46, but we can't get 46 directly with the remaining numbers.\n\nFinally, let's consider:\n- If we use 84 - 67, we get 17.\n- Then we need 16 more to reach 33, which can be 29 - 13. But we can't get 13 directly.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n- 84 - 79 = 5\n- 67 - 5 = 62\n- 62 - 29 = 33\n\nSo, 67 - (84 - 79) - 29 = 33\n\nThis works because:\n67 - 5 - 29 = 62 - 29 = 33\n\nSo, the equation is 67 - (84 - 79) - 29 = 33.\n</think>\n<answer> 67 - (84 - 79) - 29 </answer>"}]

Let's approach this step-by-step. We need to use the numbers 20, 37, and 35 to create an equation that results in 10. We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each number can only be used once.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using division. If we divide 35 by a number, we might get a result close to 10. Let's try 35 / 3.5, but since 3.5 isn't one of our numbers, we need to explore other combinations.\n\nNext, let's think about subtraction or addition/subtraction. If we subtract 37 from a larger number, we might get closer to 10. Let's try 20 - 37, which gives us -17. Adding 35 to -17 would give us 18, which is close but not 10.\n\nAnother approach is to use multiplication. If we multiply 20 by a fraction, we might get 10. However, 20 * (1/2) = 10, but we can't use 1 or 2 here.\n\nLet's try a combination of subtraction and division. If we subtract 35 from 37, we get 2.

This is closer to our number 43, and we have 17 and 75 left. \n\nIf we subtract 17 from 49, we get 32, which is not close to 75. \n\nIf we add 17 to 49, we get 66, which is closer to 75. \n\nIf we subtract 75 from 66, we get -9, which is not what we want.\n\nNow, let's try a different combination. We can try adding 43 and 30 to get 73, and then add 6 (which is 75 - 69, but we can't use 69). Instead, let's try:\n43 + 30 - 75 + 17.\n\n43 + 30 = 73\n73 - 75 = -2\n-2 + 17 = 15\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe can try:\n75 - 17 = 58\n58 + 30 = 88\n88 - 43 = 45\n\nThis also doesn't work. \n\nLet's try:\n43 + 30 = 73\n73 + 17 = 90\n90 - 75 = 15\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n75 - 43 = 32\n32 - 17 = 15\n15 + 30 = 45\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\nAfter several trials, I realize the correct combination is:\n75 - 43 + 17 + 30 = 79\n\nLet's verify:\n75 - 43 = 32\n32 + 17 = 49\n49 + 30 = 79\n\nSo, the equation is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>75 - 43 + 17 + 30</answer>"}]

Let's try another combination:\n92 - 68 = 24\n24 + 28 - 25 = 27 (too low)\n\nThe correct combination seems to be:\n92 - 68 = 24\n24 + 25 = 49\n49 + 28 = 77\n\nSo the equation is 92 - 68 + 25 + 28 = 77.\n</think>\n<answer> 92 - 68 + 25 + 28 </answer>"}]

We have the numbers: 62, 31, 29, and 3.\n2. We need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 67.\n\nWe can start by trying different combinations:\n\n- If we add 31 and 3, we get 34. This is close but not enough.\n- If we add 62 and 3, we get 65. This is close but still not enough.\n- If we add 62 and 31, we get 93. This is too much.\n\nNow, let's consider using subtraction or division to reduce the sum:\n\n- If we subtract 29 from 62, we get 33. This is closer but still not enough.\n- If we subtract 29 from 31, we get 2. This is too small.\n- If we divide 62 by 3, we get approximately 20.67, which is too small.\n- If we divide 31 by 3, we get approximately 10.33, which is also too small.\n\nGiven the above, let's try combining subtraction and addition:\n\n- If we subtract 29 from 31, we get 2. Then, if we add 3 to this result, we get 5. Finally, if we add 62 to this, we get 67.\n\nSo, the equation is: 62 + (31 - 29) + 3\n\nThe final answer is: <answer> 62 + (31 - 29) + 3 </answer>"}]

Instead, I can use 21 - 19 = 2, and then 16 / 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the equation is 72 - (16 / (21 - 19)) = 72 - (16 / 2) = 72 - 8 = 64.\n</think>\n<answer> 72 - (16 / (21 - 19)) </answer>"}]

We can use any combination of the four basic arithmetic operations. Let's try to find a combination that works.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using subtraction and division since we might be able to get closer to 96 by reducing a larger number.\n\nWe can start by subtracting 75 from 99, which gives us 24. Now we need to find a way to use 94 and 98 to get to 96 from 24.\n\nIf we divide 98 by 94, we get a fraction, which might not be helpful directly. Instead, we can think of using these numbers in a way that allows us to add or subtract to reach 96.\n\nA potential approach is to use 98 - 94, which equals 4. Now we need to see how we can use 24 and 4 to get to 96.\n\nIf we add 24 and 4, we get 28, which is still far from 96. However, if we multiply 24 by 4, we get 96, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, we can form the equation as follows:\n99 - 75 = 24\n98 - 94 = 4\n24 * 4 = 96\n\nTherefore, the equation using all the numbers exactly once is:\n(99 - 75) * (98 - 94)\n</think>\n<answer> (99 - 75) * (98 - 94) </answer>"}]

Let's consider the numbers: 91, 90, 18, 10.\n\nFirst, I notice that 91 is close to 76, so I might be able to use it in the equation. We could subtract a number to get from 91 to 76, which would be 15. However, the other numbers don't directly give us 15. \n\nAnother approach is to consider if we can use division or multiplication to get close to 76. Multiplying 90 by 18 seems too large, and 91 * 10 is 910, which is too high. \n\nIf we divide 90 by 18, we get 5. This is closer to what we need. Now, we can subtract 5 from 91 to get 86, and then subtract 10 to get to 76.\n\nSo the equation could be: 91 - (90 / 18) - 10\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n91 - (90 / 18) - 10 = 91 - 5 - 10 = 76\n\nThis works out correctly.\n</think>\n<answer> 91 - (90 / 18) - 10 </answer>"}]

We need to use four numbers [68, 27, 70, 10] and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 35.\n2. Let's start by trying to subtract or add to get closer to 35, as these operations are simpler and more likely to give us the exact result we need.\n3. Considering the numbers, 70 is the highest and 10 is the lowest, so we could potentially use subtraction or division to reduce 70.\n4. If we subtract 10 from 70, we get 60. We now need to get 25 from the remaining numbers [68, 27].\n5. To get 25, we could use 27 - 2. However, 2 is not in our list, and we can only use our given numbers.\n6. Instead, let's try another combination using multiplication or division.\n7. If we divide 68 by 2, we get 34, which is very close to 35. We can reach 35 by adding 1 to 34.\n8. We can get 3 by subtracting 27 from 27, but we can't use the same number twice. So, we need to find another way.\n9. We can multiply 27 by 1 to keep it as 27, and then we need to find a way to get 9 from the remaining numbers.\n10. We can get 9 by subtracting 10 from 19, but again, we can't use the same number twice.\n11. Instead, let's try subtracting 27 from 68 first, then divide by 2, and see if we can get 35.\n12. 68 - 27 = 41. Now, if we divide 41 by 2, we get 20.5, which is not 35.\n13. Let's try another approach: (70 - 68) * (27 - 10) / 27\n14. (70 - 68) = 2\n15. (27 - 10) = 17\n16. 2 * 17 = 34\n17. 34 / 27 \u2248 1.258, which is not 35.\n18.

However, direct subtraction or division doesn't seem to give us a clear path to 25. \n\nLet's try to use multiplication or addition with these numbers:\n- \\(96 + 15 = 111\\), which is too large.\n- \\(96 - 15 = 81\\), still too large.\n- \\(96 \\div 15 \\approx 6.4\\), not close enough.\n\nNext, let's try combining 42 with the other numbers:\n- \\(42 + 15 = 57\\), which is still too large.\n- \\(42 - 15 = 27\\), closer but still not 25.\n- \\(42 \\div 15 \\approx 2.8\\), not a clear path to 25.\n\nNow, let's consider a combination of 98, 42, and 15:\n- \\(98 - 42 = 56\\), which is still too large.\n- \\(98 - 15 = 83\\), also too large.\n- \\(98 \\div 15 \\approx 6.53\\), not useful.\n\nFinally, let's try a combination including 96, 42, and 15:\n- \\(96 - 42 = 54\\), which is still too large.\n- \\(96 - 15 = 81\\), still too large.\n- \\(96 \\div 15 \\approx 6.4\\), not useful.\n\nThe best approach seems to be using 96, 15, and 42 in a combination that brings us closer to 25. Let's try:\n- \\(96 - 42 = 54\\), then \\(54 - 29 = 25\\). We need 29, and we have 15 and 98 left.

We can use 14 to get to 81 by adding 83, but we don't have 83.\n- If we subtract 77 from 79, we get 2. We can use 53 to get to 81 by subtracting 51, but we don't have 51.\n\nSince direct subtraction or addition doesn't work, let's try multiplication and division:\n- Multiplying 77 and 79 will give a much larger number, so that's not helpful.\n- Dividing 79 by 77 will give a small fraction, so that's not helpful either.\n\nNow, let's try to use 53 and 14:\n- Dividing 53 by 14 gives a fraction, so that's not helpful.\n- Multiplying 53 and 14 gives 742, which is too large.\n\nSince we can't get 81 directly from these operations, let's try to use the numbers in a different way:\n- We can use 77 and 79 in a way that we can add or subtract a small number to get 81.\n- We can use 53 and 14 in a way that we can get a small number to add to 77 or 79.\n\nLet's try 79 - 77 = 2, and then 81 - 2 = 79. We can use 14 and 53 to get a small number to subtract from 79:\n- We can use 53 - 14 = 39, and then 79 - 39 = 40, but that's not helpful.\n- We can use 14 - 53 = -39, and then 79 - (-39) = 118, but that's not helpful either.\n\nFinally, let's try 79 - 77 = 2, and then 81 - 2 = 79. We can use 53 and 14 to get 2:\n- We can use 53 - 14 * 3 = 53 - 42 = 11, and then 11 - 9 = 2, but that's not helpful.\n- We can use 14 * 3 - 53 = 42 - 53 = -11, and then -11 + 13 = 2, but that's not helpful either.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I realize we need to use the numbers in a more complex way.

Let's consider the numbers and try to find a combination that works:\n\n1. First, notice that 84 and 76 are much larger than 40, so they should be used in a way that subtracts from a product or sum that gets close to 40.\n2. The number 5 is small, so it could be a candidate for subtraction or division.\n3. The number 43 is close to 40, so it could be a starting point.\n\nLet's try to use 43 and see how we can get to 40 using the other numbers. If we subtract 3 from 43, we get 40. Now we need to form 3 using the other numbers:\n\n- \\(84 - 76 = 8\\)\n- \\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n\nSo, we can form 3 using 84, 76, and 5. Now, if we subtract 3 from 43, we get 40.\n\nThus, the equation is: \\(43 - (84 - 76 - 5)\\)\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\\(84 - 76 = 8\\)\n\\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\(43 - 3 = 40\\)\n\n</think>\n<answer> 43 - (84 - 76 - 5) </answer>"}]

Let's try:\n- (77 - 62) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5\n- (77 - 62) * 3 = 15 * 3 = 45 (which is not 22)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- (77 - 62) + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18 (which is not 22)\n\n- (62 - 77) + 3 = -15 + 3 = -12 (which is not 22)\n\n- (62 - 77) * 3 = -15 * 3 = -45 (which is not 22)\n\n- (77 - 62) - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 (which is not 22)\n\n- (62 - 77) / 3 = -15 / 3 = -5 (which is not 22)\n\n- (62 - 77) / 3 + 27 = -5 + 27 = 22\n\nThis combination works.\n\n</think>\n<answer>(62 - 77) / 3 + 27</answer>"}]

First, consider 21 as a potential base or starting point:\n   - 21 + 6 = 27 (too low)\n   - 21 - 6 = 15 (too low)\n   - 21 * 6 = 126 (too high)\n   - 21 / 6 = 3.5 (too low)\n\n2.

Now, consider 99:\n   - 99 + 6 = 105 (too high)\n   - 99 - 6 = 93 (too high)\n   - 99 * 6 = 594 (too high)\n   - 99 / 6 = 16.5 (too high)\n\n4. We need to find a combination that works:\n   - Let's try (99 - 6) * (13 - 21) / 13:\n     - First, calculate 99 - 6 = 93\n     - Then, 13 - 21 = -8\n     - So, 93 * -8 = -744\n     - Finally, -744 / 13 \u2248 -57.23 (not 36)\n\n5. We need to adjust the approach:\n   - Let's try 99 - 66 (66 = 21 * 3 - 3):\n     - First, calculate 21 * 3 = 63\n     - Then, 63 - 3 = 60\n     - So, 99 - 60 = 39 (too high)\n\n6. Another approach:\n   - Let's try (21 - 6) * (13 / 3):\n     - First, calculate 21 - 6 = 15\n     - Then, 13 / 3 \u2248 4.33\n     - So, 15 * 4.33 \u2248 64.95 (too high)\n\n7. Final attempt:\n   - Let's try (99 / 3) - (21 - 6):\n     - First, calculate 99 / 3 = 33\n     - Then, 21 - 6 = 15\n     - So, 33 - 15 = 18 (too low)\n\nAfter several attempts, the correct combination seems to be:\n(99 / 3) - (21 - 6) = 33 - 15 = 18 (still not 36)\n\nAfter further examination, the correct combination is:\n(99 - 21) / (13 / 6) = 78 / (13 / 6) = 78 * (6 / 13) = 78 * 0.4615 \u2248 36\n\nHowever, this is not exact. Let's try:\n(99 - 21) / (13 / 6) = 78 / (13 / 6) = 78 * (6 / 13) = 78 * 0.4615 \u2248 36\n\nThis is still not exact, but the closest we can get with the given numbers and operations.\n\nGiven the constraints and available numbers, the closest we can get is 36.

Let's try different combinations:\n\n- We can start by seeing if we can get close to 96 by multiplying or adding the numbers directly. However, none of the direct combinations (41 + 16 + 8 + 39, 41 * 16, etc.) give us 96.\n- Another approach is to consider using division or subtraction to get closer to 96. We can try to use 41 and 39 first since they are closer to 96.\n\nLet's try 41 - 39 which gives us 2, and then we need to get 48 to make it 96.\n\n- We can use 16 * 8 = 128, which is too big, but if we divide by 2, we get 64. Now we need 32 more to reach 96.\n\n- If we add 2 (from 41 - 39) to 64, we get 66, which is still not 96. We need 30 more.\n\n- If we consider using 16 and 8 in a different way, we can try 16 * 6, but we don't have a 6.
