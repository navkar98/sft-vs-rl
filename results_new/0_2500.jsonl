However, we have already used 2 and 54, and we haven't used 17 yet, so let's check if we can use 17 in another way.\n\n- We can multiply 17 by 2 to get 34.

Since 78 and 51 are larger, they might be used as the dividend and divisor, respectively, with 16 being the number to subtract from the result.\n2. Another approach is to use addition and subtraction, but since we need to reach a smaller number (11) and we have larger numbers, this might be less likely to work directly.\n3.

If we add 24 and 34, we get 58, which when added to 88 gives 146, which is not 98.\n11. If we subtract 24 and 34 from 88, we still don't get 98.\n12. The only combination that works is: (88 - 24) + 34 = 64 + 34 = 98.\n\nSo, the equation is (88 - 24) + 34 = 98.\n\n<answer>(88 - 24) + 34</answer>"}]

We can't simply add or subtract the other numbers to 97 to get 41, as it would be too large or too small.\n2. Next, let's consider the possibility of using multiplication or division.

Subtracting 24 from 39 gives us 15.\n\nSo, 98 - 59 - 24 = 15.\n</think>\n<answer> 98 - 59 - 24 </answer>"}]

We can try subtracting the smaller numbers from the larger ones.\n- Multiplication: Multiplying any two numbers from the set won't give us 43.\n- Division: Dividing any number by another won't give us 43.\n\nLet's try subtraction with 74 and 61:\n74 - 61 = 13 (too small)\n\nNow, let's try subtracting 30 from 61:\n61 - 30 = 31 (still too small)\n\nNext, we can try using 74 and 30:\n74 - 30 = 44, which is close but still too large.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n74 - (61 - 30) = 74 - 31 = 43\n\nThis combination works as 61 - 30 = 31 and then 74 - 31 = 43.\n</think>\n<answer> 74 - (61 - 30) </answer>"}]

Another approach is to subtract 32 from 80 to get 48, and then subtract 80 - 32 = 48 from 80 to get a positive number. 80 - 32 = 48, and 48 + 44 = 92.\n\nSo, the equation that works is 80 - 32 + 44.\n</think>\n<answer> 80 - 32 + 44 </answer>"}]

Let's try different operations:\n\n1. Start with 69, as it is one of the given numbers. We need to check if we can use the other numbers to make an equation equal to 69.\n2. Check if we can use the other numbers with basic arithmetic operations to get 0 or a multiple of 69. This could be useful to cancel out or add up to 69.\n\nLet's try:\n- 69 + 14 = 83 (too high)\n- 69 - 14 = 55 (too low)\n- 69 * 14 = 966 (too high)\n- 69 / 14 = 4.93 (not an integer, and close but not exact)\n- 69 + 94 = 163 (too high)\n- 69 - 94 = -25 (too low)\n- 69 * 94 = 6474 (too high)\n- 69 / 94 = 0.73 (not an integer, and too low)\n- 69 + 80 = 149 (too high)\n- 69 - 80 = -11 (too low)\n- 69 * 80 = 5520 (too high)\n- 69 / 80 = 0.86 (not an integer, and too low)\n\nNone of the direct additions or subtractions with the other numbers work. Let's try multiplication and division in combination:\n\n- 94 - 80 = 14\n- 69 * 14 = 966 (too high)\n- 69 / 14 = 4.93 (not an integer, and close but not exact)\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n- 94 - 80 = 14\n- 69 + 14 = 83 (too high)\n- 69 - 14 = 55 (too low)\n- 69 * 14 = 966 (too high)\n- 69 / 14 = 4.93 (not an integer, and close but not exact)\n\nAfter trying multiple combinations, it seems we need to find a way to use all numbers and get exactly 69. Let's try a different approach:\n- 94 - 80 = 14\n- 69 - 14 = 55 (too low)\n- 69 + 14 = 83 (too high)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n69 - (94 - 80) = 69 - 14 = 55 (too low)\n69 + (94 - 80) = 69 + 14 = 83 (too high)\n\nAfter multiple trials, it seems we cannot directly get 69 using all the numbers with basic arithmetic operations. However, we can use the closest value and add or subtract to get 69.\n\nThe closest we can get is:\n69 + (80 - 94) = 69 + (-14) = 55 (too low)\n\nSo, the closest we can get is:\n69 + (80 - 94) + 14 = 69 + 0 = 69\n\nThus, the equation is:\n69 + (80 - 94) + 14 = 69\n\n-thinking-\nThe given numbers and the requirement to use each number only once and basic arithmetic operations makes it challenging to directly get 69. However, the closest we can get is by using the equation:\n69 + (80 - 94) + 14 = 69\n\n- The subtraction inside the parentheses first: (80 - 94) = -14\n- Then the equation becomes: 69 + (-14) + 14 = 69\n- Simplifying: 69 - 14 + 14 = 69\n\nThus, the equation that equals 69 using the numbers [14, 69, 94, 80] and basic arithmetic operations is:\n69 + (80 - 94) + 14 = 69\n\n<answer>69 + (80 - 94) + 14</answer>"}]

Since 85 is very close to 79, we can add or subtract a small number to get 85. We have the numbers 1, 38, and 43 left. \n\n1. Adding 1 to 79 gives 80, which is 5 less than 85.\n2. Adding 38 to 79 gives 117, which is too much.\n3.

Using 66, 84, and 2, we need to consider division, subtraction, or a combination of both.\n\nConsidering these, let's try:\n- 84 - 66 = 18 (too low)\n- 66 - 84 = -18 (too low, and negative)\n- 66 - (84 / 2) = 66 - 42 = 24 (too low)\n- 84 - (66 / 2) = 84 - 33 = 51 (this works!)\n\nThe equation 84 - (66 / 2) equals 51.\n</think>\n<answer> 84 - (66 / 2) </answer>"}]

We can subtract 28 from 39 (which isn't directly there, so we need to create 39 from the available numbers or use a combination that gets us close).\n\n- If we use 13 and 11, we have 24, which is not close to 39.\n- If we use 41 and subtract 28, we get 13, which is not 11 but is close.\n\nTo get exactly 11, we can use the following approach:\n<think> 41 - 28 = 13, then 13 - 2 = 11.

Let's try to add or subtract 13 and 19 in a way that, when combined with 72, we get 66.\n\nIf we subtract 13 from 72, we get 59. To get from 59 to 66, we need to add 7. We can get 7 by subtracting 19 from 26 (26 - 19 = 7). But we don't have 26, so we need to find another way.\n\nInstead, let's try a different combination. If we add 13 and 19, we get 32. To get from 32 to 66, we need to add 34. But we don't have 34 directly, so we need to use 72 in a different way.\n\nIf we subtract 19 from 72, we get 53. To get from 53 to 66, we need to add 13, which we do have.\n\nSo, the equation we need is 72 - 19 + 13 = 66.\n</think>\n<answer> 72 - 19 + 13 </answer>"}]

First, let's try combining the numbers in a way that might simplify the result. We can start by subtracting a larger number from a smaller one to see if we can get close to 30.\n\n2. Consider the difference between 87 and 55: \n   87 - 55 = 32\n   This is close to 30, but not quite there.\n\n3. Now, we can try to use 75 and 58 in a way that will adjust our result.\n   If we subtract 75 from 58, we get:\n   58 - 75 = -17\n   This is quite far from 30, but we can use this to our advantage.\n\n4. We can now combine the results of these operations in a way that will give us 30. Let's subtract the result of 58 - 75 from 87 - 55:\n   (87 - 55) - (58 - 75) = 32 - (-17) = 32 + 17 = 49\n   This is still not 30, but it's a step closer.\n\n5.

Let's try to use 58 in a way that will help us get 19. If we divide 58 by 75 and subtract it from the previous result, we can get closer to 30:\n   (87 - 55) - (58 - 75) - (58 / 75) = 49 - (58 / 75)\n   However, this is not correct as it does not simplify to 30. We need to find a simpler way.\n\n7. Instead, let's consider the possibility of using division and subtraction:\n   87 - 55 - (75 / 58) = 32 - 1.2931 = 30.7069 (approximately 31, not 30)\n\n8. After re-evaluating, we realize we can use:\n   (87 - 55) - (75 / 58) = 32 - 1.2931 = 30.7069 (approximately 31, not 30)\n\n9. Let's try another combination:\n   87 - 55 - (75 / 58) = 32 - 1.2931 = 30.7069 (approximately 31, not 30)\n\n10.

We could try to use division to get a smaller number and then manipulate it.\n\nOne approach is to use division to get a smaller number and then subtract or add to get 56. Let's try:\n- (76 - 96) / 76 = -20 / 76 = -10 / 38 (which doesn't seem to get us to 56).\n- We need to find a way to get a positive result close to 56. Let's try:\n- 96 - 76 = 20\n- Now, we need to manipulate 76 to get to 56. We can do this by dividing 76 by something to get a smaller number and then adding it to 20.\n- 76 / 76 = 1\n- 20 + 1 = 21 (which is too low, so we need to adjust).\n\nAnother approach is to use the numbers in a different combination:\n- (76 - 96) + 76 = -20 + 76 = 56\n</think>\n\n<answer> (76 - 96) + 76 </answer>"}]

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to identify a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to achieve the target of 57. One approach is to consider subtraction and division operations, as they can help reduce the larger numbers to a target smaller value.\n\nLet's try to approach the problem by first subtracting a smaller number from a larger one and then adjusting with the third number.\n\nConsider the following steps:\n1. Start with the largest number, 88.\n2. Subtract the second largest number, 60, from 88:\n   \\[\n   88 - 60 = 28\n   \\]\n3. Now, we need to use the remaining number, 85, in such a way that when combined with 28, we get 57. Notice that 28 is less than 57, so we need to add something to 28. The only way to do this using 85 is to divide 85 by a number to get a result that can be added to 28.\n4. The most straightforward way to do this is to use 85 divided by a number that will give us a result close to the difference between 57 and 28:\n   \\[\n   85 / 5 = 17\n   \\]\n5. Now, add 17 to 28:\n   \\[\n   28 + 17 = 45\n   \\]\n6. We are still short of 57, so we need to add the remaining value:\n   \\[\n   57 - 45 = 12\n   \\]\n7. Since 12 is not directly achievable using 85 and 5, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead of dividing 85 by 5, we can use a different approach.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n1. Start with 88 - 60 = 28.\n2. Now, add 85 - 57 = 28. We need to make 57 from 28 + (85 - 57).\n\nFinally, let's recheck the correct combination:\n1. Start with 88 - 60 = 28.\n2.

Given that 17 is already in the list, we can try to create 17 using the other two numbers through basic arithmetic operations.\n\nOne simple approach could be to subtract 38 from 72 and then adjust the result to get 17:\n72 - 38 = 34\n34 - 17 = 17\n\nSo the equation would be: 72 - 38 - 17 = 17\n\nHowever, we need to use each number exactly once.

Let's explore the possibilities step by step.\n\n<think>\n1. Start with 47 and 48. We can subtract them from each other or add them. Neither of these directly gives us 24.\n2. Let's try subtracting 47 from 48: 48 - 47 = 1. This is not helpful.\n3. Now, let's try dividing 48 by 24: 48 / 24 = 2. This is closer but not 24.\n4. Consider using 24 as a factor or divisor. If we can get a factor of 24, we can potentially use it.\n5. If we subtract 47 from 48, we get 1. If we can use this 1 in conjunction with 47 or 48 and 24, we might get 24.\n6. Notice that 48 - 47 = 1. If we can use this 1 to manipulate 24, we might achieve our goal.\n7. One way to use 1 is to multiply it by 24, which gives us 24.\n8.

We need to use each number exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to reach 89.\n\nFirst, let's try to use 49 and see if we can get closer to 89 by adding or subtracting the other numbers.\n\n1. If we add 23 to 49, we get 72, which is still quite a bit away from 89.\n2. If we subtract 23 from 49, we get 26, which is even further from 89.\n3. If we add 34 to 49, we get 83, which is very close to 89.\n4. If we subtract 34 from 49, we get 15, which is far from 89.\n5. If we add 17 to 49, we get 66, which is also far from 89.\n\nFrom the above, adding 34 to 49 seems to be the closest to 89. So, we have:\n49 + 34 = 83\n\nNow, we need to get from 83 to 89. We can use 23 and 17 for this:\n\n89 - 83 = 6\n\nWe can get 6 from 23 - 17 = 6.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n49 + 34 + (23 - 17) = 89\n\nLet's simplify this:\n49 + 34 + 6 = 89\n\nNow, let's write the final equation in the required format:\n<answer> 49 + 34 + (23 - 17) </answer>"}]

Subtract 62 from 92, which gives 30.\n2. Since we need to use all numbers, we can add 60 and then subtract 92 to balance the equation.\n\nThus, the equation would be: (92 - 62) - (60 - 30).\n\nHowever, a simpler and more direct solution is to use 60 directly and adjust the other numbers to balance the equation to 30. We can use 62 and 92 in a way that the difference between them equals 30.\n\nSo, the correct equation is: 92 - 62 - 30 = 0, but we need to adjust it to fit the structure of using all numbers.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, the direct and correct equation is: 60 - (92 - 62) = 60 - 30 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is: 60 - (92 - 62) = 30.\n</think>\n<answer> 60 - (92 - 62) </answer>"}]

We can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nOne strategy is to try to combine numbers that get us closer to 52. We can start by looking at the operations that might give us a smaller number, such as division or subtraction.\n\nLet's consider 67 - 15, which would give us 52. Now, we need to figure out how to get 15 from the remaining numbers (70, 6, 91).\n\n91 - 70 = 21, and 21 - 6 = 15. So, we can use 91 - 70 - 6 to get 15.\n\nThus, we can write the equation as 67 - (91 - 70 - 6).\n</think>\n\n<answer> 67 - (91 - 70 - 6) </answer>"}]

We have the numbers [68, 20, 44, 6] and we need to use them to create an equation that equals 10. \n\n<think>\n1. First, let's consider the possibility of using division to get close to 10. We might want to use a larger number in the numerator and a smaller number in the denominator.\n2. A good starting point could be using 68 as the numerator, because it's one of the larger numbers and it's close to a multiple of 10.\n3. We need to find a combination of the other numbers (20, 44, 6) that when used with 68, gives us 10. \n4. Let's try 68 / 6 first. This gives us approximately 11.33, which is close but not exactly 10.\n5. We need to get closer to 10, so let's consider subtracting a value from 11.33. The difference between 11.33 and 10 is 1.33, so we need to find a way to make 1.33 using the remaining numbers (20 and 44).\n6. We can use the smaller numbers to get close to 1.33. If we subtract 20 from 24 (20 + 4), we get 4, which is too large. However, if we use 20 and 44 in a way that results in a smaller number, we can get closer.\n7. The only way to use 20 and 44 in a way that results in a smaller number is to divide 44 by 20, which gives us 2.2. Subtracting this from 68/6 will give us a reasonable estimate of 10.\n8. So, 68 / 6 - 44 / 20 = 10. This is a close approximation, but let's check if we can get an exact 10.\n9. Let's simplify 68 / 6 - 44 / 20. First, 68 / 6 = 11.3333 and 44 / 20 = 2.2. Subtracting these gives 11.3333 - 2.2 = 9.1333. This is close but not exact.\n10. We need to find a way to get exactly 10. Let's consider using subtraction directly with the numbers we have.\n11. If we use 68 - 20 - 44 + 6, we get 68 - 20 = 48, 48 - 44 = 4, and 4 + 6 = 10. This gives us the exact value of 10.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 68 - 20 - 44 + 6 </answer>"}]

Let's try using 84 as the base:\n   84 - 16 = 68 (close, but not enough)\n   84 - 47 = 37 (too low)\n\n3. Now, let's try using 47 as the base:\n   47 + 16 = 63 (too low)\n   47 + 84 = 131 (too high)\n\n4. Finally, let's try using 16 as the base:\n   16 * 4 = 64 (too low, but close)\n   16 * 92 = 1472 (too high)\n\n5. Looking at these results, it seems we need to subtract. Let's try:\n   92 - 21 = 71\n   But 21 isn't in the list, so we need to create 21 using the available numbers.\n\n6. We can create 21 using:\n   84 - 47 = 37\n   37 - 16 = 21 (using subtraction)\n\nTherefore, the equation could be:\n92 - (84 - 47 - 16)\n</think>\n<answer> 92 - (84 - 47 - 16) </answer>"}]

If we divide 52 by 2, we get 26. Now we need to add a number to 26 to get 78. 78 - 26 = 52, which is one of our numbers, so this is a valid solution.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (52 / 2) + 52 </answer>"}]

We can only use each number once and we can use the basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest numbers and see if we can get close to 27 using them. The closest we can get without going over 27 is 32 (97 - 62), which is too high. So, we need to use smaller numbers to reduce it.\n\nIf we use 97 and subtract 62, we get 35.

If we subtract 44 from 81, we get 37, which is far from 71. However, if we add 37 to 34, we get 71. So, we need to find a way to get 37 and 34 using the given numbers.\n\nWe can get 37 by subtracting 4 from 41, but 4 is not available. Instead, we can get 37 by adding 3 to 34. We can get 34 by subtracting 3 from 37, but again, 37 is not directly available. We need to use the numbers we have.\n\nAnother approach is to use division and subtraction. If we divide 81 by 3, we get 27. We can then add 44 to 27 to get 71.\n\nSo, the equation is: (81 / 3) + 44 = 71.\n\nLet's verify: (81 / 3) + 44 = 27 + 44 = 71.\n\nThe equation satisfies the conditions of using each number exactly once and only using basic arithmetic operations.\n\n</think>\n<answer> (81 / 3) + 44 </answer>"}]

If we subtract 70 from it, we get:\n84 - 70 = 14\n\nNow we have 14, and we need to use the remaining numbers 13 and 17 to get to 56. If we multiply 14 by 4, we will get 56.

Let's try:\n70 - (17 - 13) * 8\n\nSimplifying:\n70 - 4 * 8\n70 - 32 = 38\n\nThis is incorrect. Let's simplify directly:\n(84 - 70) * (17 - 13)\n\nSimplifying:\n14 * 4 = 56\n\nThis works.

Let's start by considering the operations and how they might be used.\n\nOne approach is to try to use division to reduce the larger numbers to a smaller target. We can start with 99 and 20, since 99 is close to 100 and 20 is a smaller number that could be useful.\n\nIf we divide 99 by 20, we get approximately 4.95. This is close to 5, which might be useful if we can adjust it to 24.\n\nNext, we can consider using 12 and 83, as they are the remaining numbers. If we subtract 12 from 83, we get 71.\n\nNow, we need to use 4.95 and 71 to get 24. We can do this by subtracting 4.95 from 71, which gives us approximately 66.05. However, this is not 24, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nAnother approach is to use 12 directly and see if we can manipulate the other numbers to get 24. If we divide 83 by 20, we get 4.15, which is close to 4. We can then multiply this by 12 to get close to 48, but we need to adjust to get 24.\n\nA better approach might be to use 99 and 20 directly. If we subtract 20 from 99, we get 79. Now, we need to use 83 and 12 to get from 79 to 24. If we divide 83 by 12, we get approximately 6.92. If we subtract this from 79, we get approximately 72.08, which is still not 24.\n\nFinally, let's try a different combination. If we subtract 12 from 20, we get 8. If we then divide 83 by 8, we get 10.375. If we subtract this from 99, we get approximately 88.625. This is still not 24.\n\nAfter trying several combinations, we find that the correct approach is to use 99 - 83 + 20 - 12.

We need to use basic arithmetic operations to combine these numbers to reach 90. One approach could be to use addition and multiplication.\n\nLet's start by trying to multiply two numbers and then add the rest. However, none of the pairs (21, 22), (21, 38), (21, 18), (22, 38), (22, 18), or (38, 18) multiply to a number close to 90.\n\nNext, let's try to use subtraction and/or division in conjunction with addition.\n\nIf we subtract 18 from 90, we get 72, and 72 is still not a product of the given numbers. If we subtract 22, we get 68, and 68 is also not a product. If we subtract 21, we get 69, and 69 is also not a product.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the possibility of division. If we divide 38 by 2, we get 19, and if we then add this to 71 (90 - 19), we get 90. However, 71 is not one of our numbers.\n\nLet's try to use 38 in a different way. If we divide 38 by 18, we get approximately 2.11, which is not an integer. We need an integer result.\n\nLet's consider using 38 and 22 together. If we multiply 38 by 2, we get 76. Now, if we add 14 (90 - 76), we get 90. The number 14 is not one of our numbers, so let's try another combination.\n\nIf we multiply 22 by 4, we get 88. Now, if we add 2 (90 - 88), we get 90. The number 4 is not one of our numbers, so let's try another combination.\n\nIf we multiply 21 by 4, we get 84. Now, if we add 6 (90 - 84), we get 90. The number 6 is not one of our numbers, so let's try another combination.\n\nIf we multiply 18 by 5, we get 90. Now, we need to check if we can form 5 using the remaining numbers. If we add 22 and 21 and subtract 38, we get 5 (22 + 21 - 38 = 5).\n\nSo, the equation is: 18 * (22 + 21 - 38) = 90.</think>\n<answer>18 * (22 + 21 - 38)</answer>"}]
