If we subtract 60 from a larger number, we are likely to get closer to 42. The only way to use 9 and 2 to get a larger number is through multiplication: 9 * 2 = 18.

The simplest way is to subtract 7 from 60: 60 - 7 = 53, which is too large.\n\nAnother approach is to use division in conjunction with addition or subtraction. We can do (9 / 2) = 4.5.

We notice that if we take 60 and subtract 18, we get 42.

We should consider using smaller numbers in combination with 76.\n2. Let's try to get a factor of 24 from 76. The closest factor is 3, but 76 / 3 is not an integer. Another approach could be using 76 - 52, but 52 is not one of our numbers.\n3. Consider using division. We need a number that when divided by another number, the result is 24. A good candidate is 48, but we don't have 48. However, 76 - 52 = 24, and 52 is not our number, but we can make 52 using 55 - 3.\n4. Now, we need to find a way to get 3. We can use 60 - 57, but 57 is not one of our numbers. However, 60 - 55 = 5, and 5 - 2 = 3, but we need to find 2.\n5. We can use 76 - 74 to get 2, but we don't have 74. Instead, we can use 76 - 74 = 2, and 74 = 76 - 2.\n6. So, the equation becomes: (76 - (76 - 2)) - (60 - 55) = 24.\n\nLet's simplify:\n(76 - 74) - 5 = 24\n2 - 5 = -3 (This doesn't work, so let's try another approach)\n\nAnother approach:\n(60 - 55) * (76 / 47) = 5 * (76 / 47)\n76 / 47 is not an integer, so this doesn't work either.\n\nAnother approach:\n(76 - 60) + (55 - 47) = 16 + 8 = 24\n\nThis works! Let's verify:\n76 - 60 = 16\n55 - 47 = 8\n16 + 8 = 24\n\nSo, the equation that works is (76 - 60) + (55 - 47).\n</think>\n<answer> (76 - 60) + (55 - 47) </answer>"}]

Let's try a different approach: we can use multiplication to get closer to 92. Multiplying 5 by 45 gives us 225, which is too high but shows we need to scale down.\n6. Instead, let's see if we can use 5 in a division or subtraction to get the right balance. If we divide 52 by 5, we get 10.4, which is too high but shows we need a smaller number.\n7.

However, 48 * 44 = 2112, which is much larger than 90.\n\nAnother approach is to use division first, but since 90 is not a simple multiple of 2, 48, or 44, this seems less likely to work directly.\n\nLet's try to use 2 in a way that could help us reach 90.

Instead, let's try to use 2 as a factor in a way that can help us reach 90.\n\n48 - 44 = 4, and if we multiply this by 2, we get 8.

Let's try adding 53 and 60:\n\n53 + 60 = 113\n\nThis is close to 94, but we need to reduce it by 19. We can use the remaining numbers 33 and 14 to achieve this. Trying to subtract 33 from 113 gives us 80, which is still too low. Instead, let's try subtracting 14 from 113:\n\n113 - 14 = 99\n\nThis is close, but we need to reduce it by 5. We can use 33 - 14 = 19, but we need to reduce by 5, not 19. Instead, let's try using 33 - 14 = 19 and then subtract this from 99:\n\n99 - 19 = 80\n\nWe need to increase 80 to 94. We can do this by adding 14:\n\n80 + 14 = 94\n\nSo, the equation we need is 53 + 60 - (33 - 14).\n</think>\n\n<answer> 53 + 60 - (33 - 14) </answer>"}]

One approach could be to think about how we can use 92 as a base and adjust it using the other numbers.\n\nIf we subtract 24 from 92, we get 68. This leaves us with 30 to get to 86 from 68. We can add 30 to 68 to get 98, which is too much. We need to subtract 12 from 98 to get 86.

Start with 4 as a potential starting point:\n   - 4 + 73 = 77 (too large)\n   - 4 - 73 = -69 (too small)\n   - 4 * 73 = 292 (too large)\n   - 4 / 73 = 0.0548 (too small)\n\n2. Next, consider 73 as a starting point:\n   - 73 + 4 = 77 (too large)\n   - 73 - 4 = 69 (too small)\n   - 73 * 4 = 292 (too large)\n   - 73 / 4 = 18.25 (too large)\n\n3. Consider 97 as a starting point:\n   - 97 + 4 = 101 (too large)\n   - 97 - 4 = 93 (too small)\n   - 97 * 4 = 388 (too large)\n   - 97 / 4 = 24.25 (too large)\n\n4. Finally, consider 18 as a starting point:\n   - 18 + 4 = 22 (too large)\n   - 18 - 4 = 14 (too large)\n   - 18 * 4 = 72 (too large)\n   - 18 / 4 = 4.5 (too small)\n\nAfter considering these initial combinations, we need to explore more complex equations. Let's try combining the numbers in a different way:\n\n- Consider the combination of 73 - 97 = -24 (too small)\n- Then, add 4: -24 + 4 = -20 (still too small)\n- Finally, add 18: -20 + 18 = -2 (too small)\n\n- Consider the combination of 97 - 73 = 24 (too large)\n- Then, subtract 4: 24 - 4 = 20 (too large)\n- Finally, subtract 18: 20 - 18 = 2 (too small)\n\n- Consider the combination of 18 - 73 = -55 (too small)\n- Then, add 4: -55 + 4 = -51 (still too small)\n- Finally, add 97: -51 + 97 = 46 (too large)\n\n- Consider the combination of 18 - 4 = 14 (too large)\n- Then, subtract 73: 14 - 73 = -59 (too small)\n- Finally, add 97: -59 + 97 = 38 (too large)\n\n- Consider the combination of 4 - 18 = -14 (too small)\n- Then, add 73: -14 + 73 = 59 (too large)\n- Finally, add 97: 59 + 97 = 156 (too large)\n\n- Consider the combination of 73 - 18 = 55 (too large)\n- Then, subtract 97: 55 - 97 = -42 (too small)\n- Finally, add 4: -42 + 4 = -38 (too small)\n\n- Consider the combination of 18 - 4 = 14 (too large)\n- Then, subtract 73: 14 - 73 = -59 (too small)\n- Finally, add 97: -59 + 97 = 38 (too large)\n\n- Consider the combination of 97 - 4 = 93 (too large)\n- Then, subtract 18: 93 - 18 = 75 (too large)\n- Finally, subtract 73: 75 - 73 = 2 (too small)\n\n- Consider the combination of 4 - 73 = -69 (too small)\n- Then, add 97: -69 + 97 = 28 (too large)\n- Finally, subtract 18: 28 - 18 = 10 (this works!)\n\nThus, the correct combination is: 4 - 73 + 97 - 18 = 10.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n<answer> 4 - 73 + 97 - 18 </answer>\n</think>\n</answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. If we try to use 84 as a base, we can't simply subtract or divide 46 from 84 to get 37, as that would result in a negative or a non-integer.\n2. We can consider division and multiplication to manipulate the numbers. One approach could be to divide 84 by a number and then manipulate the result.\n\nLet's try:\n- 84 / 46 does not result in a useful number for our purpose.\n- 46 / 1 = 46, which is too large.\n- Adding or subtracting 46 from 84 does not help.\n\nAnother approach could be to subtract or add 46 to/from a product or division involving 1. However, since 1 does not significantly change the value when added or subtracted (as 1*1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, etc.), we need to look for a more direct approach.\n\nOne effective way is to subtract 1 from 46, which gives us 45, and then subtract this from 84:\n84 - (46 - 1) = 84 - 45 = 39, which is close but not 37.\n\nLet's try:\n- 84 - 46 = 38, which is closer but still not 37.\n- 84 - 46 + 1 = 39, which is still not 37.\n\nA better approach is to use division and subtraction:\n84 / 46 is approximately 1.826, and if we subtract 1 (which can be obtained from 46 - 45), we might get closer. But we need to find a direct way.\n\nConsidering the numbers again, we can use:\n46 - (84 - 45) = 46 - 39 = 7, which is not our target.\n\nFinally, the correct approach is:\n46 - (84 - 46) = 46 - 38 = 8, which is still not correct.\n\nThe correct approach is to use:\n84 - 46 - 1 = 37.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 84 - 46 - 1 </answer>"}]

Then, 45 / 32 is approximately 1.41, which is not close to 13.\n- If we subtract 32 from 78, we get 46. Then, 46 / 33 is approximately 1.39, which is close to 13.\n- If we multiply 32 and 33, we get 1056, which is too large.\n- If we multiply 32 and 78, we get 2496, which is too large.\n- If we multiply 33 and 78, we get 2574, which is too large.\n\nFrom the above, the closest we got using division was 46 / 33, which is approximately 1.39. To get closer to 13, we need to use addition:\n- If we add 32 to 78, we get 110. Then, 110 / 33 is approximately 3.33, which is not close to 13.\n- If we add 33 to 78, we get 111. Then, 111 / 32 is approximately 3.47, which is not close to 13.\n- If we add 32 to 33, we get 65. Then, 65 / 78 is approximately 0.83, which is not close to 13.\n\nNow, let's try a different approach:\n- If we subtract 32 from 78, we get 46. Then, 46 - 33 is 13.\n\nSo, the equation is 78 - 32 - 33 = 13.</think>\n<answer> 78 - 32 - 33 </answer>"}]

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n<think>\nTo form an equation that equals 39 using the numbers [11, 74, 24] exactly once, we need to consider the possible operations we can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nFirst, let's try multiplication and addition since they can help us reach a large number such as 39.\n- Multiplying 11 and 24 gives us 264, which is too large.\n- Multiplying 11 and 74 gives us 814, which is also too large.\n\nNext, let's try a combination of multiplication and subtraction:\n- If we multiply 24 by 74, we get 1776, which is still too large.\n- If we multiply 11 by 24, we get 264, still too large.\n- If we multiply 11 by 74, we get 814, still too large.\n\nNow, let's try subtraction and addition:\n- 74 - 24 = 50, which is close but not enough.\n- 74 - 11 = 63, which is close but not enough.\n- 24 - 11 = 13, which is too small.\n\nFinally, let's try a combination of multiplication and addition/subtraction:\n- (74 - 11) * 24 = 63 * 24 = 1512, which is too large.\n- (74 - 24) * 11 = 50 * 11 = 550, which is too large.\n- (24 - 11) * 74 = 13 * 74 = 962, which is too large.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, we notice that dividing 74 by 24 is not a whole number, and this doesn't help. So, we need to find a way to use 39 directly.\n\nIf we look at the numbers closely, we can see that 74 - 35 = 39. We can get 35 by 11 * 3, but we don't have a 3. However, we can get 35 by 11 * (74/24 - 1).\n\nLet's calculate:\n74 / 24 = 3.0833, which is approximately 3.\n3 * 11 = 33, which is close but not 35.\n\nInstead, we can use:\n74 - (24 - 11) = 74 - 13 = 61, which is too large.\n\nFinally, we can try:\n74 - (24 - 11) = 74 - 13 = 61, which is too large.\n\nThe correct combination is:\n74 - (24 - 11) = 74 - 13 = 61, which is too large.\n\nWe need to find a better combination:\n(74 - 11) - 24 = 63 - 24 = 39.\n\nSo, the equation is (74 - 11) - 24 = 39.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(74 - 11) - 24</answer>"}]

Adding 47 and 80 gives us 127, which is too high. Subtracting 47 from 80 gives us 33, which is too low. Multiplying or dividing 47 by 80 does not give us 87.\n\nNext, let's try using 87 as a target and see if we can reach it by subtracting or dividing from 80:\n80 - 27 = 53\n80 - 20 = 60\n\nNow, we need to find a way to get to 87 using these results. Adding 20 or 27 to 53 or 60 does not work. We can try subtracting or dividing, but none of those operations will yield 87 from either 53 or 60.\n\nFinally, let's try a different approach by combining all numbers in a multiplication or division setup:\n80 + 27 = 107\n80 - 27 = 53\n20 * 27 = 540\n20 * 80 = 1600\n\nNone of these directly give us 87.

We can subtract 15 from 91 - 95, but that would give us a negative number, which isn't helpful. Instead, we can use 95 - 15.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n95 - (88 - 73) = 95 - 15 = 80\nThis is too high, so we need to adjust. We can use 91 and subtract the result from it.\n\n91 - (88 - 73) = 91 - 15 = 76\nThis is still too high, so we need to find a way to get closer to 25. We can use division to adjust the result.\n\n(95 - 88) / 73 * 91 = 7 / 73 * 91 = 0.0962 * 91 = 8.76\nThis is still not close to 25, so we need to think of another approach.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n95 - 73 - 88 + 91 = 25\nThis works because:\n95 - 73 = 22\n22 - 88 is a negative number, which we don't want.\nInstead, we can use:\n95 - 73 = 22\n22 + 91 - 88 = 25\n</think>\n\n<answer> 95 - 73 + 91 - 88 </answer>"}]

We need to find an equation that uses each number exactly once and results in 49. \n\nOne possible way to approach this is to consider the operations that can bring us closer to 49. Addition and subtraction might not directly get us to 49, so we should consider multiplication and division.\n\nIf we look at 89, it's a large number and might not be easily manipulated to 49. However, we can try to use 19 or 21 in conjunction with 89.\n\nOne approach is to use multiplication. If we multiply 89 by a fraction that results in 49, it might work. We can set up the equation as follows: \n\\[ 89 \\times x = 49 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{49}{89} \\]\n\nNow, we need to check if we can use 19 or 21 to get this fraction.\n\nIf we use 19:\n\\[ 89 \\times \\frac{19}{21} = \\frac{89 \\times 19}{21} \\]\nThis does not equal 49.\n\nIf we use 21:\n\\[ 89 \\times \\frac{21}{19} = \\frac{89 \\times 21}{19} \\]\nThis does not equal 49 either.\n\nGiven the constraints, it seems we need a different approach. Let's try subtracting and then dividing.\n\nIf we subtract 19 from 21, we get:\n\\[ 21 - 19 = 2 \\]\n\nNow, if we divide 89 by 2, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{89}{2} = 44.5 \\]\n\nThis is close but not 49. We need to find a way to adjust this to get 49. \n\nGiven the constraints and the numbers involved, we can try:\n\\[ 89 - 21 + 19 = 87 \\]\n\nThis is close but not 49. We need to adjust further.\n\nLet's try:\n\\[ 89 - 19 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 70 - 21 = 49 \\]\n\nThis works and uses each number exactly once.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\\[ 89 - 19 - 21 = 49 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: </think>\n<answer> 89 - 19 - 21 </answer>"}]

If I subtract 79, I get a negative number, which isn't what we want. Let's try adding or multiplying.\n\nIf I add 79 to 32, I get 111. Still not 46. If I subtract 79 from 32, it's a negative number, so that's not helpful. Let's try to use 32 in a different way.\n\nIf I subtract 32 from 79, I get 47. That's close, but not quite 46. If I subtract 32 from 93, I get 61, which is too large.\n\nLet's try using 32 in a multiplication or division to see if we can get closer to 46.\n\nIf I multiply 93 by 32, that's too large. If I divide 93 by 32, I get a number less than 3, which is too small. If I multiply 79 by 32, that's too large. If I divide 79 by 32, I get a number less than 3, which is too small.\n\nGiven these options, let's try to create the equation by combining the numbers in different ways.\n\n93 - 79 = 14. This is close to 46, but not quite. If I add 32 to 14, I get 46. This works!\n\n<answer> 93 - 79 + 32 </answer>"}]

We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Given the numbers are quite large and the target is 41, it's likely that division or subtraction will be involved.\n\nLet's try to see if we can subtract or divide to get close to 41.\n\n1. If we subtract 71 from 99, we get 28, which is not close to 41.\n2. If we subtract 13 from 99, we get 86, which is also not close to 41.\n3. If we subtract 71 from 13, we get -58, which is even further from 41.\n4. If we subtract 13 from 71, we get 58, which is closer but still not 41.\n5. If we divide 99 by 71, we get a number less than 2, which is not close to 41.\n6. If we divide 99 by 13, we get 7.615, which is also not close to 41.\n7. If we divide 71 by 13, we get 5.461, which is closer but still not 41.\n\nNow, let's consider multiplication and addition/subtraction:\n- If we multiply 13 by 3, we get 39, which is close to 41.\n- If we subtract 2 from 39, we get 37, which is not 41.\n- If we add 2 to 39, we get 41.\n\nNow we need to see if we can get 39 using the numbers 99, 71, and 13. \n- If we subtract 13 from 71, we get 58, which is not helpful.\n- If we subtract 13 from 99, we get 86, which is not helpful.\n- If we add 13 to 71, we get 84, which is not helpful.\n\nWe need to consider a different approach. Let's try:\n- If we subtract 71 from 99, we get 28.\n- If we subtract 13 from 28, we get 15, which is not close to 41.\n- If we add 13 to 28, we get 41.\n\nSo the equation would be: 99 - 71 + 13 = 41.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 99 - 71 + 13 </answer>"}]

Let me reason through this problem step by step.\n\nTo find an equation using the numbers [17, 92, 95, 87] that equals 73, I will try to combine these numbers with basic arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's start by considering the closest numbers to 73 and see if we can manipulate them:\n- 92 is close to 73, so we can try subtracting or adding a number from the remaining set to get to 73.\n- If we subtract 92 from 95, we get 3, which is too small.\n- If we subtract 92 from 87, we get -5, which is also too small.\n- If we subtract 92 from 17, we get -75, which is far too small.\n\nGiven that 92 is quite large and subtracting it from other numbers gives results that are too small or negative, let's consider using addition:\n- Adding 17 to 73 gives 90, which is too large.\n- Adding 95 to 73 gives 168, which is too large.\n- Adding 87 to 73 gives 160, which is also too large.\n\nSince direct addition or subtraction doesn't seem to work, let's try multiplication or division:\n- Dividing 92 by 17 gives approximately 5.41, which is not close to 73.\n- Dividing 95 by 17 gives approximately 5.59, which is also not close.\n- Dividing 87 by 17 gives approximately 5.12, which is not close.\n\nLet's now consider a combination of operations:\n- If we subtract 17 from 92, we get 75, which is close to 73.\n- Then, if we subtract 87 from 75, we get -12, which is not what we want.\n- If we subtract 87 from 95, we get 8, which is not what we want.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- If we subtract 17 from 95, we get 78, which is close to 73.\n- Then, if we subtract 87 from 78, we get -9, which is not what we want.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- 95 - 87 = 8\n- 92 - 17 = 75\n- 75 - 8 = 67 (still not 73)\n\nAfter several attempts, I found a combination that works:\n- 95 - 17 = 78\n- 92 - 87 = 5\n- 78 - 5 = 73\n\nThus, the equation is (95 - 17) - (92 - 87) = 73.\n\n<answer> (95 - 17) - (92 - 87) </answer>"}]

The number 77 is larger than 88 and 40, and it's too large to directly be part of the solution as we need to reach 29.\n4.

But 75 and 84 are both smaller than 91, so subtracting them directly from 91 will not get me 82.\n\nNext, I consider using 84 in the equation. If I subtract 84 from 91, I get 7, which is far from 82. If I subtract 84 from 75, I get -9, which is even further from 82.\n\nGiven that subtraction isn't leading me anywhere close to 82, I turn to addition. Adding 84 to 75 gets me 159, which is too high.

I should try different combinations to see which one works.\n\nOne way to approach this is to start by considering the largest numbers, as they might be more flexible in terms of operations.\n\nIf I use 88 and 74, I can try to get a number close to 63 by subtracting or dividing. Let's try 88 - 74 first:\n88 - 74 = 14\n\nThis is too small, so I need to find a way to get a larger number that can be adjusted to 63. I can try to use 77 with one of the results, but it seems difficult to get there directly. Let's try another combination:\n\nAnother option is to use 88 and 77. If I divide 88 by 77, I get a fraction, which isn't useful for reaching an integer like 63. So, let's try to use 74 with these two numbers:\n\nUsing 77 and 74, I can try to create a fraction that equals 63. One way to do this is to use 77 as the denominator and find a numerator that, when divided by 77, equals 63. So, I need:\nNumerator / 77 = 63\nNumerator = 63 * 77\nNumerator = 4851\n\nThis is much larger than both 88 and 74, so this approach is not feasible.\n\nNow, let's try to use 88 and 74 in a multiplication or addition/subtraction combination. If I subtract 74 from 88, I get:\n88 - 74 = 14\n\nThis is still too small. Let's see if we can use 77 in a way that helps:\n\nIf I use 77 as a multiplier or divisor, I can try:\n77 * (88 - 74) = 77 * 14 = 1078\n\nThis is still not 63. Let's try another combination:\n\nIf I use 77 and 88 in a subtraction, I get:\n88 - 77 = 11\n\nThis is not enough to get to 63.

Let's try another combination:\n\nIf I use 74 and 77 in a subtraction, I get:\n77 - 74 = 3\n\nThis is still not enough to get to 63. Now, let's try to use 74 in a way that helps with the other two numbers:\n\nIf I use 74 and 88 in a combination, I can try:\n(88 - 74) / 77 = 14 / 77 = 2 / 11\n\nThis is not 63. Let's try another combination:\n\nIf I use 77 and 88 in a combination, I can try:\n77 / (88 - 74) = 77 / 14 = 5.5\n\nThis is not 63.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, let's consider the large number 90 and see if we can use it in a way to bring down the value closer to 12.\n2. We can subtract 39 from 90, which gives us 51.\n3. Now we need to use the remaining 39 to get to 12. Since 51 is too large, we can't simply subtract 39 from it to get 12. Instead, we need to think of a way to divide or multiply.\n4. If we divide 51 by 39, we get approximately 1.3, which is not 12.\n5. However, if we take the reciprocal of 39 and multiply it by 51, we can get closer to 12. The reciprocal of 39 is 1/39. Multiplying 51 by 1/39 gives us 51/39, which simplifies to 17/13, which is not 12.\n6. Another approach is to use subtraction in a different way. If we subtract 39 from 90, we get 51. Then if we divide 51 by 39, we get 51/39, which simplifies to 17/13, still not 12.\n7. A better approach is to use subtraction and division. We can do 90 - 39 = 51, and then 51 / 39 = 17/13, which is not 12.\n8. Finally, let's try a different combination. If we subtract 39 from 90, we get 51. Then we can divide 51 by 39 and subtract the result from 12. This doesn't seem to work either.\n9. After several attempts, we realize that we can use the numbers in a different order. If we use 90 - 39 = 51, and then 51 / 39 = 17/13, we still don't get 12. The key is to use the numbers in a way that directly results in 12.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 90 - 39 - 39 = 12. This uses each number exactly once and the result is 12.\n</think>\n<answer> 90 - 39 - 39 </answer>"}]

Let's solve the problem step by step without the image.\n\n<think>\nWe need to use the numbers 86, 41, and 70 to create an equation that equals 25 using basic arithmetic operations. Let's try different combinations:\n- If we use subtraction, we can try 86 - 41 - 70, but that equals -25.\n- If we use addition, we can try 86 - 41 + 70, but that equals 115.\n- We can also try division, but it seems less likely to get 25 as a whole number result.\n\nLet's focus on multiplication and division:\n- 86 / 41 is approximately 2.1, which is close but not enough.\n- 41 / 70 is less than 1, so it won't help us reach 25.\n- Let's try 70 - 41 = 29, and then see if we can adjust it to 25.\n\nIf we take 70 - 41, we get 29. To get from 29 to 25, we can subtract 4 (but we don't have 4, so let's think of another way).\n\nAnother approach is to use 86 somehow. If we subtract 41 from 86, we get 45. Then we need to adjust it to 25. We can use 45 - 20, but we don't have 20 directly.\n\nLet's try a combination:\n- 86 - 41 = 45\n- 45 - 70 = -25 (not what we want)\n- 70 - 41 = 29\n- 29 - 4 (not possible directly)\n\nThe closest we can get is by using 70 - 41 = 29, and then we can use 86 / 7 = 12.2857, but we need to use 41 in a way that helps us get to 25.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- 86 - 70 = 16\n- 16 - 41 = -25 (not what we want)\n- 41 - 70 = -29 (not what we want)\n- 86 - 41 = 45\n- 45 - 20 = 25 (but we don't have 20)\n\nAfter trying different combinations, it seems the best way is to use 70 - 41 = 29, and then we need to adjust it to 25, but with the given numbers, we can't directly get to 25 without using the same number twice or using a number not in the list.\n\nThe closest we can get is 70 - 41 = 29, but we need to find a way to adjust it to 25. After re-evaluating, it seems we need to use a different approach or combination that we haven't tried yet.\n\nLet's try:\n- 86 - 70 = 16\n- 16 - 41 = -25 (not what we want)\n\nAfter rechecking, the only way to get exactly 25 is by using:\n70 - (86 - 41) = 70 - 45 = 25\n</think>\n\n<answer> 70 - (86 - 41) </answer>"}]

One approach is to use 93 - 54 = 39, and then try to use the second 93 to adjust this result.\n\nIf we do 93 - (54 - 93), we get:\n93 - 54 + 93 = 132 - 54 = 78 (too high)\n\nInstead, let's try 93 - (54 - 93) in a different way:\n93 - (54 - 93) = 93 - 54 + 93 = 132 - 54 = 78 (still too high)\n\nAnother approach is to use division.

However, the given question requires a mathematical equation using the numbers 32, 66, 25, and 99 to equal 26. Let's approach this mathematically.\n\n<think>\nTo solve this, we need to combine the numbers in a way that results in 26. We can try different combinations and operations.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the numbers 32 and 66. We can subtract 66 from 32, but that would yield a negative number, which isn't helpful. We can also add, multiply, or divide these numbers in various combinations.\n\nLet's try using 99 and 25 next. We know that 99 - 25 = 74, which is too large. If we divide 99 by 25, we get 3.96, which is also not helpful.\n\nNow, let's consider using 32, 66, 25, and 99 in combination. We can start with 99 - 66 = 33. Now, we need to use 32 and 25 to get to 26. If we subtract 25 from 32, we get 7. If we add 33 and 7, we get 40, which is still not 26.\n\nAnother combination to try is to use 32 and 99. If we divide 99 by 32, we get approximately 3.09375.

If we divide 74 by 3, we get approximately 24.67, which is close but not 26.\n\nFinally, let's try a different approach. We can use 99 - 73 = 26. If we can form 73 using 32, 25, and 66, we might be able to solve this. We can see that 66 - 32 = 34, and 34 + 25 = 59, and 59 + 14 = 73. However, we don't have a 14, so this isn't a valid combination.\n\nAfter considering various combinations, the most promising approach is to use 99 - 66 = 33, then 33 - 7 = 26. We can form 7 by using 32 - 25 = 7.\n\nThus, the equation is: 99 - 66 - (32 - 25).\n</think>\n<answer> (99 - 66) - (32 - 25) </answer>"}]

We can use each number only once and the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).\n\nLet's start by trying to use division since 49 is a prime number and it's unlikely to be the result of addition or subtraction with the given numbers.\n\nIf we divide 85 by 37, we get approximately 2.3, which is not close to 49. \n\nNext, if we divide 97 by 37, we get approximately 2.62, which is also not close to 49.\n\nGiven that division isn't giving us a solution, let's try multiplication. If we multiply 97 by 37, we get a much larger number than 49. So, multiplication isn't the solution.\n\nNow, let's try addition and subtraction. If we add 85 and 37, we get 122, which is too large. If we subtract 37 from 85, we get 48, which is close to 49 but not exact. We need to use 97 somehow to get to 49.\n\nIf we subtract 97 from 85, we get -12, which is too small. If we subtract 37 from 97, we get 60, which is too large.\n\nConsidering the operations and the numbers, the best way to get 49 using these numbers is to use subtraction with 97.\n\nSo, we need to find a combination that brings us to 49. The closest we can get is by adjusting the numbers slightly. If we use 97 - 37, we get 60. Then, if we subtract 11 from 60, we get 49. We can get 11 by using 85 - 74 (but 74 is not one of the numbers).\n\nA possible solution is to use the numbers in a way that 97 - 37 - (85 - 97) = 49. However, this is a bit complex. A simpler approach is to directly subtract 37 from 85 and then add 12, which can be derived from 97 - 85.\n\nSo, the equation is: (97 - 85) + (85 - 73), but since 73 is not an exact number formed by the given numbers, we need to find a simpler direct approach.\n\nThe correct and simplest approach is: 97 - 48, but we need to form 48 using the given numbers.

If we subtract 11 from 40, we get 29.\n\nSo, we can form the equation: (4 * 10) - (93 - 82) = 29.\n</think>\n<answer> (4 * 10) - (93 - 82) </answer>"}]

We can either add, subtract, multiply, or divide it. Since 50 is close to 60, we can think of using addition or subtraction with the other numbers.\n\n1.

If we multiply 27 and 58, we get 1566 which is far too large.\n\nSince direct multiplication isn't working, let's try addition and subtraction.\n\n- Adding all three numbers (27 + 8 + 58) gives 93 which is close but not 77.\n- Subtracting 8 from the sum of 27 and 58 gives 77.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 58 + 27 - 8 = 77.\n</think>\n<answer> 58 + 27 - 8 </answer>"}]

First, consider the largest number, 14. We should try to use it in such a way that it can get us close to 27.\n2. Notice that 14 * 2 = 28, which is very close to 27. So, we can use multiplication involving 14.\n3. Now, let's see if we can use 6 and 7 to get 1 (or a similar value) to adjust the result from 28 to 27.\n4. If we take 14 * (6 - 7), we get 14 * (-1) = -14, which is far from what we need.\n5. Instead, we can try 14 * (6 / 7), which equals 14 * (0.857) \u2248 12.001 (not useful here).\n6. The best way seems to be to use 14 as the base and adjust with the other two numbers. We can do 14 + 6 + 7.\n\nThus, the equation using the numbers 14, 6, and 7 exactly once, and basic arithmetic operations to equal 27 is:\n\n<answer> 14 + 6 + 7 </answer>"}]

Let's consider division as well:\n74 / 2 = 37 (but 74 isn't divisible by 2, so this isn't useful).\n\nNow, let's try a different approach:\n74 - 61 = 13\n35 + 72 = 107\n107 - 13 = 94\n\nThis combination uses all the numbers and results in 94.\n</think>\n<answer> 35 + 72 - (74 - 61) </answer>"}]

This simplifies the problem to finding a way to use the other numbers (12, 55, 43) to either equal 0 or to balance the equation. \n\nLet's try to use 43 and 12 in a way that the result, when combined with 55, will give us 21.\n\nIf we subtract 43 from 55, we get 12.\n55 - 43 = 12\n\nNow, to get 21, we need to add 9 to 12 (since 12 + 9 = 21).

First, we can try to subtract the smaller numbers from the larger ones.\n2. 77 - 59 = 18, which is too small and doesn't help us get closer to 41.\n3. Another approach could be to use division or multiplication. However, these operations might not help directly in this case.\n4. Let's consider if we can get a number close to 41 by adding or subtracting the numbers.\n5. If we subtract 59 from 77, we get 18, which is still not close to 41.\n6. We can try to use 59 twice.

If we subtract 16 from 34, we get 18, and we can use 59 - 43 = 16.\n10. Therefore, we can use 59 - (77 - 41) = 59 - 36 = 23, but this is not correct.\n11.

Let's start by considering possible combinations and operations.\n\nFirst, I'll consider using division and subtraction. The division operation can help reduce the larger numbers to get closer to 60. \n\nI notice that 96 is much larger than 60, so it might be a good candidate for division. Let's check if using 96 / 51 can get us close to another number we can combine with the remaining numbers to reach 60.\n\n96 / 51 is not an integer, so let's try 96 / 57:\n\n96 / 57 is approximately 1.684, which isn't helpful since we need an exact integer or a simpler fraction.\n\nNext, let's try 57 / 96:\n\n57 / 96 is approximately 0.59375, which again isn't helpful.\n\nNow, let's try using 48 in conjunction with the division operation:\n\n48 / 51 is approximately 0.941, which again isn't helpful on its own.\n\n48 / 57 is approximately 0.8421, which isn't helpful either.\n\n48 / 96 is 0.5, which is closer but still not useful on its own.\n\nAt this point, I need to consider if there's a way to use subtraction or addition with these numbers.

We can get 21 from 48 - 27, but 27 isn't one of our numbers. Instead, we can use 48 - 39, which is 9, and add this to 51:\n\n51 + 9 = 60.\n\nSo, the equation is 51 + (48 - (96 - 57)).\n\nFinal answer: <answer> 51 + (48 - (96 - 57)) </answer>"}]

First, let's try to use 93 directly. Since we need the result to be 93, using 93 itself would be the most straightforward way.\n2. However, we need to use other numbers (34, 52, and 34) in the equation as well. Let's consider how we can incorporate these.\n3. One approach is to use the other numbers to manipulate the 93 to get the desired result. We can start by using the numbers 34 and 52. \n\nLet's try to use 93 + 34 - 52 - 34:\n- 93 + 34 = 127\n- 127 - 52 = 75\n- 75 - 34 = 41\n\nThis does not equal 93.\n\nNext, let's try 93 - 34 - 52 + 34:\n- 93 - 34 = 59\n- 59 - 52 = 7\n- 7 + 34 = 41\n\nThis also does not equal 93.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we realize that we need to use multiplication or division to achieve the target. Let's try 93 * (34 / 34) - 52:\n- 34 / 34 = 1\n- 93 * 1 = 93\n- 93 - 52 = 41\n\nThis also does not work. \n\nAnother approach is to use division: 93 * (52 / 34) - 34:\n- 52 / 34 = 1.5294117647058824\n- 93 * 1.5294117647058824 = 142.52941176470588\n- 142.52941176470588 - 34 = 108.52941176470588\n\nThis also does not work.\n\nFinally, we can try 93 + (34 - 34) * 52:\n- 34 - 34 = 0\n- 0 * 52 = 0\n- 93 + 0 = 93\n\nThis works perfectly.\n\nThus, the equation is 93 + (34 - 34) * 52.\n\n<answer> 93 + (34 - 34) * 52 </answer>"}]

Subtracting it from 90 would give us 33, which is close but not 37.\n2. Adding 22 to 33 would give us 55, which is too high.\n3. Subtracting 22 from 33 would give us 11, which is too low.\n4.

Consider (44 - 15) / 2: This equals 29 / 2, which is not an integer.\n\nSince using 44 directly as a subtraction doesn't work, let's try multiplication or division with the other numbers:\n\n1.

Consider (44 - 2) / 15: This equals 42 / 15, which is not an integer.\n\nNow, let's try to use 15 in a different way:\n\n1. Consider 15 + 6: This equals 21, which is far from 26.\n2. Consider 15 + 2: This equals 17, which is far from 26.\n3. Consider 15 * 2: This equals 30, which is far from 26.\n4.

The number 42 is the largest, so it might be useful to divide or subtract from it to get closer to 24. Let's try using 42 first.\n\nIf we divide 42 by 14, we get 3. Now we need to see if we can use the remaining numbers (40 and 32) to get from 3 to 24 using the remaining operations.\n\n40 - 32 = 8, and 8 * 3 = 24. This works! So, the equation would be 40 - 32 * (42 / 14).\n\nLet's verify the steps:\n1. 42 / 14 = 3\n2. 32 * 3 = 96\n3. 40 - 96 = -56 (which is incorrect)\n\nIt seems I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try a different combination. Since 42 and 14 are both even, we can consider subtracting them to see if we can get a value that works with the other numbers.\n\n42 - 14 = 28, and we need to use 40 and 32 to get from 28 to 24. 40 - 32 = 8, and 28 - 8 = 20, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach: using multiplication and division directly with 42 and 14.\n\n42 / 14 = 3, and we need to use 40 and 32. 40 - 32 = 8, and 8 * 3 = 24. This looks promising.\n\nLet's write it out again to confirm:\n1. 42 / 14 = 3\n2. 40 - 32 = 8\n3. 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis confirms our solution is correct.

This gives us 87 - 16 = 71, and 71 - 10 = 61, which is not 73.\n\n4. Let's try 87 - 10 - 16. This gives us 87 - 10 = 77, and 77 - 16 = 61, which is not 73.\n\n5. Let's try 87 - 16 + 10. This gives us 87 - 16 = 71, and 71 + 10 = 81, which is not 73.\n\n6. Let's try 87 - 10 + 16. This gives us 87 - 10 = 77, and 77 + 16 = 93, which is not 73.\n\n7. Let's try 87 + 16 - 10. This gives us 87 + 16 = 103, and 103 - 10 = 93, which is not 73.\n\n8. Let's try 87 + 10 - 16. This gives us 87 + 10 = 97, and 97 - 16 = 81, which is not 73.\n\n9. Let's try 87 - 16 / 10. First, we need to do the division: 16 / 10 = 1.6. Then 87 - 1.6 = 85.4, which is not 73.\n\n10. Let's try 87 - 10 / 16. First, we do the division: 10 / 16 = 0.625. Then 87 - 0.625 = 86.375, which is not 73.\n\n11. Let's try 16 * 10 - 87. This gives us 160 - 87 = 73, which is the target number.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is 16 * 10 - 87 = 73.\n</think>\n<answer> 16 * 10 - 87 </answer>"}]

We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get 40.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using subtraction and division. Notice that 72 - 48 = 24. However, 24 is not close to 40, so we need to find another combination.\n\nNext, consider using multiplication and division. We can see that 72 / 33 is approximately 2.18, which isn't helpful. We need a combination that results in a number closer to 40.\n\nA useful strategy here is to look at the numbers that can be combined to get a number close to 40. If we use 48 and 33, we can try to get a result close to 40 by either adding, subtracting, or dividing them.\n\nLet's try:\n(72 - 48) * (33 / 48)\n\nFirst, calculate 72 - 48, which equals 24.\nNext, calculate 33 / 48, which is approximately 0.6875.\nFinally, multiply 24 by 0.6875, which equals 16.5.\n\nThis is not 40, so let's try another combination.\n\nLet's try:\n(72 - 48) + (33 / 48)\n\nFirst, calculate 72 - 48, which equals 24.\nNext, calculate 33 / 48, which is approximately 0.6875.\nFinally, add 24 + 0.6875, which is approximately 24.6875.\n\nThis is still not 40, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's try:\n(72 - 48) + (48 / 33)\n\nFirst, calculate 72 - 48, which equals 24.\nNext, calculate 48 / 33, which is approximately 1.4545.\nFinally, add 24 + 1.4545, which is approximately 25.4545.\n\nThis is still not 40, so let's try one more combination.\n\nLet's try:\n(72 - 33) - (48 / 48)\n\nFirst, calculate 72 - 33, which equals 39.\nNext, calculate 48 / 48, which equals 1.\nFinally, subtract 1 from 39, which equals 38.\n\nThis is close but not 40.

Now, we need to use 34 and 66 to get to 16. If we use 34 and 66 with the result of 2, we can see that \\(2 \\times 34 = 68\\) which is too high, and \\(2 \\times 66 = 132\\) which is also too high.

If we divide 32 by 2, we get 16, and we can use 14 and 16 to get 2, so \\(14 - 16 = -2\\) and then we need to reverse the sign, so we can use \\(-14 + 16 = 2\\).\n\nSo, the equation can be: \\(\\frac{66 - 34}{14 - 16}\\).\n\nLet's simplify: \\(\\frac{32}{-2} = -16\\), but we need 16, so we need to adjust the signs or operations.

We can use 93 - 87 (which is 6):\n49 - 6 = 43\n\nSo, the equation is:\n(50 - 1) - (93 - 87) = 43\n</think>\n<answer> (50 - 1) - (93 - 87) </answer>"}]

First, we can try to use subtraction or addition to get close to 84, and then adjust with multiplication or division.\n2. We can start by looking at the closest number to 84, which is 76.

First, we need to find a way to use the numbers 97, 36, 9, and 81 to get 12.\n\n2. We notice that 97 is much larger than 12, so we probably need to use it in a way that reduces its value significantly. One way to do this is by dividing it.\n\n3. We could try 97 / 9, which gives us approximately 10.78, still too large but getting closer.\n\n4. We can subtract 81 from 97 to get 16, and then divide by 9 to get approximately 1.78, still not 12.\n\n5. Another approach is to use 97 - 81 = 16, and then we need to reduce this to 12.\n\n6. We can use 36 to get there: (97 - 81) - (36 / 9) = 16 - 4 = 12.\n\n7.

Then we need to reduce this to 91, which means we need to subtract 67. However, we don't have a 67, so this approach won't work directly.\n\nAnother approach is to consider using division. If we divide 79 by 79, we get 1. Then we need to find a way to use 70 and 20 to reach 91. \n\nIf we add 70 and 20, we get 90. Adding 1 to 90 gives us 91. So, we need to set up an equation where 79 / 79 = 1, and then 70 + 20 + 1 = 91.\n\nThus, the equation would be: (79 / 79) + 70 + 20\n</think>\n<answer> (79 / 79) + 70 + 20 </answer>"}]

Let's start by looking at the differences between the numbers and see if we can find a combination that works.\n\nFirst, let's try subtracting 85 from 98:\n98 - 85 = 13\n\nNow, we need to see if we can use the remaining numbers (14 and 31) to get to 47. If we add 13 to 31, we get:\n13 + 31 = 44\n\nWe are 3 short of 47, so we need to add 44 to 3:\n44 + 3 = 47\n\nWe can get 3 by subtracting 14 from 14, but since we can't use a number twice, we need to rethink. \n\nInstead, let's try a different approach by looking at multiplication and division. If we divide 98 by 2, we get 49, which is close to 47. We can use 14 for this division:\n98 / 14 = 7\n\nNow, we need to use 85 and 31 to get to 47. If we subtract 7 from 54 (which is 85 - 31), we get:\n54 - 7 = 47\n\nSo, we can use the equation:\n(85 - 31) - (98 / 14) = 47\n\nThis simplifies to:\n54 - 7 = 47\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n(85 - 31) - (98 / 14)\n</think>\n<answer> (85 - 31) - (98 / 14) </answer>"}]
