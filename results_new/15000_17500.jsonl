If we subtract 7 from 78, we get 71. However, we need to get 27, not 71.\n4. Instead, if we multiply 7 by 3, we get 21, which is close to 27. We can achieve this by adding 6 to 15, but we don't have 6 or 15. So, let's try another approach.\n5. If we subtract 7 from 85, we get 78 - 53 = 25, which is close to 27.

We need to use these numbers exactly once to get the result of 52. One way to approach this is to try to get close to 52 by using multiplication or division, and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n- If we take 87 and divide it by 74, we get approximately 1.1756756756756757, which doesn't help much in getting to 52.\n- If we add 74 and 87, we get 161, which is too high.\n- If we subtract 87 from 74, we get -13, which is too low.\n- If we add 65 to 87, we get 152, which is also too high.\n- If we subtract 65 from 87, we get 22, which is still not 52.\n- If we try 65 * 52, we get 3380, which is much too large.\n- If we try 65 / 52, we get approximately 1.25, which is too small.\n\nGiven these attempts, it seems we should use 65 in a way that it can be subtracted or added to adjust the result.

Since we have 74 - 65 = 9, we can adjust by using this:\n87 - (65 - 9) = 87 - 56 = 31, which is not 52.\n\nAfter re-evaluating, the correct approach is:\n74 - (87 - 65) = 74 - 22 = 52.\n\nSo the equation is 74 - (87 - 65) = 52.</think>\n<answer>74 - (87 - 65)</answer>"}]

If we subtract 28 from 74, we get 46. Then, adding 99 to 46 would give us 145, which is too large. So, this combination doesn't work.\n\nNext, let's consider using division. If we divide 74 by 28, we get approximately 2.64, which is not useful for reaching 53. So, division with these numbers is not a viable option here.\n\nNow, let's try multiplication. Multiplying 74 and 28 gives us 2072, which is far too large. Multiplying 74 and 99 gives us 7326, which is also far too large. Multiplying 28 and 99 gives us 2772, which is still not close to 53.\n\nThe only viable operation left is to use subtraction in combination with multiplication or addition.

We have to use the numbers 21, 54, and 70 to create an equation that results in 37. We can use any combination of the operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Let's start by trying to get close to 37 using these numbers.\n\n1. First, we can try to subtract or add a combination of the numbers to get close to 37. One way to do this is to look at the difference between 70 and 37, which is 33. We can then try to use the other numbers (21 and 54) to get to 33.\n2. If we subtract 21 from 54, we get 33. This is a promising start, so we can write the equation as (54 - 21) = 33.\n3. Now, we need to incorporate the number 70 into the equation to reach 37. We can use the remaining number 70 as a way to adjust our result. Since we need to get from 33 to 37, we can subtract 6 from 33. The equation becomes (54 - 21) - 6 = 33 - 6 = 37.\n4. We can use 70 to get the value 6 by dividing it by 12. So, the equation now looks like (54 - 21) - (70 / 12) = 37.\n\nLet's verify the final equation: (54 - 21) - (70 / 12) = 33 - (70 / 12). First, 70 / 12 = 5.8333 (approximately), and 33 - 5.8333 = 27.1667 (approximately), which is not 37. We need to adjust our approach.\n\n5. Instead of dividing, let's try using 70 - 33. This is 37, and we can incorporate 21 and 54 as follows: (70 - 33) = (70 - (54 - 21)) = 70 - 33 = 37.\n\nSo, the final equation using the given numbers and operations is (70 - (54 - 21)) = 37.\n\n<answer> (70 - (54 - 21)) </answer>"}]

So, let's try to use 2 in another way.\n\nWe can subtract 2 from 26 to get 24 and then add this to 64:\n- 64 + (26 - 2) = 64 + 24 = 88 (which is still not 92)\n\nLet's consider another approach:\n- If we multiply 26 by 3, we get 78. Adding 14 would get us to 92, but we don't have a 14. Instead, we can use 64 and 2:\n- 64 + 26 + 2 = 92\n\nThis works because we are using each number exactly once and the operations are straightforward.\n</think>\n<answer> 64 + 26 + 2 </answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. First, consider using 35 and 30:\n   - If we subtract 30 from 35, we get 5.\n   - Now, we need to use 12 to get to 14. If we add 12 to 5, we get 17, which is too high.\n   - If we subtract 12 from 5, we get -7, which is too low.\n\n2. Next, consider using 12 and 35:\n   - If we divide 35 by 12, we get approximately 2.92, which is not useful as it's not an integer and we need an exact result of 14.\n   - If we add 12 to 35, we get 47, which is too high.\n   - If we subtract 12 from 35, we get 23, which is too high.\n   - If we multiply 12 by 35, we get 420, which is too high.\n\n3. Finally, consider using 12 and 30:\n   - If we divide 30 by 12, we get 2.5, which is not useful as it's not an integer.\n   - If we add 12 to 30, we get 42, which is too high.\n   - If we subtract 12 from 30, we get 18, which is too high.\n   - If we multiply 12 by 30, we get 360, which is too high.\n\n4. Now, let's try a combination of all three numbers:\n   - If we start with 35 and subtract 30, we get 5.\n   - Then, if we add 12 to 5, we get 17, which is too high.\n   - Instead, if we use 35 - (30 - 12), we get 35 - 18 = 17, which is too high.\n   - If we use 35 - (30 / 12), we get 35 - 2.5 = 32.5, which is too high.\n   - If we use 35 - (12 * 30), we get 35 - 360 = -325, which is too low.\n   - If we use 35 - (30 / 12 * 12), we get 35 - 30 = 5, which is too low.\n   - If we use 30 / (12 - 35), we get 30 / -23, which is a negative number and not useful.\n\n5. Let's try a different approach:\n   - If we use 30 - (35 - 12), we get 30 - 23 = 7, which is too low.\n   - If we use 35 - (30 - 12), we get 35 - 18 = 17, which is too high.\n   - If we use 30 - (35 - 12), we get 30 - 23 = 7, which is too low.\n   - If we use 35 / (30 - 12), we get 35 / 18, which is approximately 1.94, which is not useful.\n   - If we use (30 - 12) / 35, we get 18 / 35, which is approximately 0.51, which is not useful.\n\n6.

Subtracting 92 from 62 would give us a negative number, which is not what we want.\n\nNext, let's consider using division or multiplication. Using division might help reduce a large number effectively.\nIf we divide 96 by 34, we get approximately 2.82, which is not close enough to the target.\n\nAnother strategy is to use multiplication or addition to combine numbers.\nIf we multiply 92 by 34, we get 3128, which is much larger than the target.\nIf we add 92 and 34, we get 126, still not close.\n\nLet's try a combination of subtraction and addition.\nIf we subtract 34 from 92, we get 58.\nNow we have 96 and 58. Adding these gives us 154, still not the target.\n\nLet's try the subtraction approach again but with a different order.\nIf we subtract 34 from 96, we get 62.\nNow we have 92 and 62. Subtracting 92 from 62 gives us -30, which is not helpful.\n\nFinally, let's try division and subtraction.\nIf we divide 96 by 34, we get approximately 2.82.\nNow we have 92 and 2.82. Subtracting 2.82 from 92 gives us approximately 89.18, still not the target.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I notice that if we add 34 to 92, we get 126, which is close to the target.\nIf we then subtract 58 from 126, we get 68, which is still not the target.\n\nUpon further review, the correct combination is to add 96 and 34, which gives 130, and then subtract 92, which gives the target of 38.\n\nSo the equation is (96 + 34) - 92 = 38.\n</think>\n<answer> (96 + 34) - 92 </answer>"}]

We need to find a combination where the result is 90.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- **76 + 69 - 97**: \n  76 + 69 = 145\n  145 - 97 = 48 (not 90)\n\n- **76 + 97 - 69**: \n  76 + 97 = 173\n  173 - 69 = 104 (not 90)\n\n- **76 - 69 + 97**: \n  76 - 69 = 7\n  7 + 97 = 104 (not 90)\n\n- **76 - 97 + 69**: \n  76 - 97 = -21\n  -21 + 69 = 48 (not 90)\n\n- **69 + 97 - 76**: \n  69 + 97 = 166\n  166 - 76 = 90 (this works)\n\n- **69 + 76 - 97**: \n  69 + 76 = 145\n  145 - 97 = 48 (not 90)\n\n- **69 - 97 + 76**: \n  69 - 97 = -28\n  -28 + 76 = 48 (not 90)\n\n- **69 - 76 + 97**: \n  69 - 76 = -7\n  -7 + 97 = 90 (this also works)\n\n- **97 + 76 - 69**: \n  97 + 76 = 173\n  173 - 69 = 104 (not 90)\n\n- **97 + 69 - 76**: \n  97 + 69 = 166\n  166 - 76 = 90 (this also works)\n\n- **97 - 76 + 69**: \n  97 - 76 = 21\n  21 + 69 = 90 (this works)\n\nFrom the above calculations, we have multiple correct solutions. Let's select one for the final answer:\n\n<answer> 97 + 69 - 76 </answer>"}]

We need to try different combinations using the basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFirst, let's try to use 88. Since 88 is much larger than 42, we would likely need to subtract or divide it. However, dividing 88 by 46 or 1 does not yield a useful result. So, we should try to subtract from 88.\n\nIf we subtract 46 from 88, we get 42. But we also have the number 1, which we need to use. We can incorporate 1 into the equation by either subtracting or dividing it.\n\nOne possible way is to use 1 in a way that doesn't change the result significantly. We can do this by subtracting 1 from 46 before subtracting it from 88. This would give us:\n\n88 - (46 - 1) = 88 - 45 = 43\n\nThis is close but not exactly 42. Another approach is to divide 46 by 1, which doesn't change its value, and then subtract the result from 88:\n\n88 - (46 / 1) = 88 - 46 = 42\n\nThis gives us the correct result.\n</think>\n<answer> 88 - (46 / 1) </answer>"}]

We have a large number (76) and two smaller numbers (69 and 10). It might be easier to use the smaller numbers to get closer to 17, as the large number (76) could be harder to manipulate.\n\nLet's first try adding and subtracting the smaller numbers to see if we can get close to 17:\n\n- \\(69 - 10 = 59\\)\n- \\(69 + 10 = 79\\)\n\nNeither 59 nor 79 is close enough to 17 when combined with 76. So, let's try using multiplication or division.\n\n- \\(69 \\times 10 = 690\\)\n- \\(69 / 10 = 6.9\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 76 = 760\\)\n- \\(10 / 76 = 0.13157894736842105\\)\n\nNone of these are close to 17 either. Now, let's try a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with 76.\n\n- \\(76 - 69 = 7\\)\n- \\(76 - 10 = 66\\)\n- \\(76 + 69 = 145\\)\n- \\(76 + 10 = 86\\)\n\nFrom the above, we see that \\(76 - 69 = 7\\), which is close to 17 but not quite there. We can try to use the remaining number (10) to adjust this result:\n\n- \\(7 + 10 = 17\\)\n\nSo, we can form the equation:\n\n<think>(76 - 69) + 10 = 17</think>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>(76 - 69) + 10</answer>"}]

If we subtract 52 from 71, we get:\n71 - 52 = 19, which is too small.\n\nHowever, if we add 52 to 31, we get:\n31 + 52 = 83, which is too large.\n\nThe only way to use 52 and get closer to 31 is by subtracting it from a larger number. Since 77 - 6 = 71, we can use this to our advantage:\n71 - 52 = 19, which is still too small.\n\nIt seems we need to use the division to get closer to 31. If we divide 77 by 6, we get:\n77 / 6 = 12.833333333333334, which is not an integer and doesn't help us directly.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best way to use all three numbers and get 31 is:\n77 - 52 - 6 = 19, which is too small.\n\nThe correct approach seems to be:\n77 - (52 - 6) = 77 - 46 = 31\n\nSo the equation is:\n77 - (52 - 6)\n</think>\n<answer> 77 - (52 - 6) </answer>"}]

We have the numbers 64, 76, 50, and 15. We need to create an equation that equals 77 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility of using addition and subtraction.

Now, we need to incorporate 50 and 15 to reach 77.\n\nAdding 50 to 12 gives us 62, and then adding 15 to 62 gives us 77.

If we try to use 79 or 85 as a whole, it's clear that they are too large to be manipulated to get 30 using the other number.\n2.

Now, we need to use 79 in a way that makes the expression equal to 30. If we subtract 19 from 79, we get 60. And if we add 17 to 60, we get 77, which is still not 30.\n5. Let's try a different approach: we can use 85 / 5 = 17, and then 79 - 17 = 62, which is still not 30.\n6. We need to find a way to get 30 using these numbers. Let's try 85 - 55.

Let's consider the operations:\n\n1. Addition: We can't directly add 29 and 29 to get 97 as 29 + 29 = 58, which is far from 97.\n2. Subtraction: Subtracting 29 from 97 would require a number greater than 97 to make it work, which isn't possible with the given numbers.\n3. Multiplication: Multiplying 29 by 29 would give us 841, which is too large.\n4. Division: Dividing 97 by 29 would give us a fraction, not a whole number.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible operation is multiplication. If we multiply 29 by some number, we should get 97. Since 97 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a product of two integers is 1 * 97. However, we don't have 1, so we need to think creatively.\n\nLet's try the following:\n- We have 29 and 97. If we subtract 29 from 97, we get 68. \n- Now, we need to use the second 29 to get back to 97. \n- We can add 29 to 68 to get 97.\n\nSo, the equation would be 97 - 29 + 29 = 97.\n\nLet's check:\n97 - 29 = 68\n68 + 29 = 97\n\nThis works, and we've used each number exactly once.\n</think>\n<answer> 97 - 29 + 29 </answer>"}]

First, we need to understand that we have to use the numbers 83, 70, and 3 exactly once, and we can use basic arithmetic operations.\n\n2. The goal is to get 10, which is a relatively small number, so we should consider subtraction or division as our primary operations.\n\n3. Let's try to create a scenario where we can reduce 83 or 70 to a number close to 10 by using 3.\n\n4. If we subtract 3 from 83, we get 80, which is still far from 10.\n\n5. If we subtract 3 from 70, we get 67, which is also not close to 10.\n\n6. Now let's consider division. If we divide 83 by 70, we get approximately 1.1857, which is far from 10.\n\n7. If we divide 70 by 83, we get approximately 0.8434, which is also not close to 10.\n\n8. Considering these, let's try a combination. We can subtract 3 from 83 to get 80, then divide 80 by 8 to get 10. But 8 is not one of our numbers.\n\n9. Another approach is to subtract 3 from 70 to get 67, then divide 67 by 6.7. But again, 6.7 is not one of our numbers.\n\n10. Finally, we can try subtracting 3 from 70 to get 67, and then subtract 67 from 70, which gives us 3. Now, we need to use 83 to reach 10. We can add 7 to 3 to get 10, but we don't have a 7.\n\n11. After reviewing all these, we realize that a direct combination of the given numbers using basic operations to get exactly 10 is not straightforward.\n\n12. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that if we subtract 70 from 83, we get 13, and then subtract 3, we get 10. \n\nTherefore, the equation that satisfies the conditions is:\n\n<answer>(83 - 70) - 3</answer>"}]

Let's go through the problem step by step to find an equation that uses the numbers [32, 55, 98] exactly once and results in 11 using basic arithmetic operations.\n\n<think>\n1. First, we need to consider all possible operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. We should start by trying to use division because it can potentially yield smaller numbers, which might be helpful to reach 11.\n\n3. Let's try dividing one of the larger numbers by one of the smaller ones:\n   - 98 / 32 = 3.0625 (not an integer, and it's far from 11)\n   - 98 / 55 = 1.7818 (not an integer, and it's far from 11)\n   - 55 / 32 = 1.71875 (not an integer, and it's far from 11)\n\n4. Since division doesn't seem to work directly, let's try subtraction or addition:\n   - 55 - 32 = 23 (too large)\n   - 55 - 98 = -43 (too large in the negative direction)\n   - 98 - 55 = 43 (too large)\n   - 98 - 32 = 66 (too large)\n   - 32 - 55 = -23 (too large in the negative direction)\n   - 32 - 98 = -66 (too large in the negative direction)\n\n5. Now, let's consider multiplication:\n   - 32 * 55 = 1760 (too large)\n   - 32 * 98 = 3136 (too large)\n   - 55 * 98 = 5390 (too large)\n\n6. It seems we need a combination of operations. Let's try a combination:\n   - If we try (98 - 55) / 32, we get (98 - 55) = 43, and 43 / 32 = 1.34375 (not 11)\n\n7. Let's try another combination:\n   - If we try (55 - 32) * 98, we get (55 - 32) = 23, and 23 * 98 = 2254 (too large)\n\n8. Let's try a different approach:\n   - If we try 98 / (32 - 55), we get (32 - 55) = -23, and 98 / -23 = -4.2609 (not 11)\n\n9. Now, let's try a combination of addition and subtraction:\n   - If we try (98 - 55) + 32, we get (98 - 55) = 43, and 43 + 32 = 75 (too large)\n\n10. Finally, let's try:\n    - (98 - 55) - 32 = 43 - 32 = 11 (This works!)\n\n</think>\n\nThe equation that uses the numbers [32, 55, 98] exactly once and results in 11 is:\n\n<answer> (98 - 55) - 32 </answer>"}]

Let's try dividing 80 by 40 to get 2, and then add 62 - 2 = 60.\n\nSo, the equation would be: (62 - (80 / 40)).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- 80 / 40 = 2\n- 62 - 2 = 60\n\nThus, the equation that equals 60 using the numbers [80, 40, 62] is:\n\n<answer> (62 - (80 / 40)) </answer>"}]

We need to use the other numbers to either add to or subtract from 98 to reach 69.\n\n98 - 63 = 35, which is too far from 69. Let's try another approach.\n\nIf we subtract 98 from 69, we get:\n98 - 69 = 29. We need to use 9 and 43 to get 29.\n\n9 * 43 = 387, which is too large. Instead, we can try 43 - 9 = 34, which is close but still too large.\n\nSo, we need to subtract a smaller number to get exactly 29. The only way to do this is to use 9 and 63 in conjunction.\n\n(63 - 9) = 54, and then we need to subtract 5 more to get 69. We can use 43 - 98 = -35, but we can't use a negative number. Instead, we can use 43 - 9 = 34, and then adjust by using 9 - 63 = -54, but again, we can't use a negative number.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 63 - 9 = 54, and then use 98 - 34 = 64, but we need 69, not 64. So, we need to use 98 - 35 = 63, and we already have 54, so we need to find a way to get from 54 to 69.\n\nWe can achieve this by using 63 - 9 = 54, and then adding 15, but 15 can be obtained by 43 - 28, and 28 can be obtained by 98 - 70, and 70 can be obtained by 63 + 7, which is not possible using the numbers we have.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 98 - 9 = 89, and then use 63 - 20 = 43, and we can get 20 by 63 - 43 = 20, but we need to use the numbers only once.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 98 - 29 = 69, and we can get 29 by 63 - 34, and we can get 34 by 43 - 9 = 34.\n\nSo, the correct equation is 98 - (63 - 43 + 9) = 69.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 98 - (63 - 43 + 9) </answer>"}]

Let's explore possible combinations:\n\n1. Trying multiplication: None of the numbers can be multiplied directly to get 81.\n2. Trying addition: 28 + 11 + 62 = 101, which is too high.\n3. Trying subtraction: None of the combinations of the numbers subtracted from each other will result in 81.\n4. Trying division: None of the numbers can be used to divide 81 to get a whole number that is in the list.\n\nThe only viable approach seems to be using a combination of addition and multiplication. One working solution is:\n\n62 + 2 * 11\n\nCalculating this out:\n62 + 2 * 11 = 62 + 22 = 84\n\nThis is close but not equal to 81. Let's try another combination:\n\n62 + 28 - 11\n\nCalculating this out:\n62 + 28 - 11 = 90 - 11 = 79\n\nThis is also not equal to 81. Let's try:\n\n62 + 11 - 2\n\nCalculating this out:\n62 + 11 - 2 = 73 - 2 = 71\n\nThis is not equal to 81 either. Let's try:\n\n11 * 7 + 4\n\nBut 7 and 4 are not in our list. The only combination we missed is:\n\n62 + 2 * 11 - 2\n\nCalculating this out:\n62 + 2 * 11 - 2 = 62 + 22 - 2 = 82 - 2 = 80\n\nThis is not equal to 81. The only option left is:\n\n62 - 11 + 2 * 28\n\nCalculating this out:\n62 - 11 + 2 * 28 = 51 + 56 = 107\n\nThis is not equal to 81. The only option left is:\n\n28 + 2 * 11 + 11\n\nCalculating this out:\n28 + 2 * 11 + 11 = 28 + 22 + 11 = 40 + 11 = 51\n\nThis is not equal to 81. The only option left is:\n\n28 + 2 * (62 - 11)\n\nCalculating this out:\n28 + 2 * (62 - 11) = 28 + 2 * 51 = 28 + 102 = 130\n\nThis is not equal to 81. The only option left is:\n\n28 * (11 / 2) + 62\n\nCalculating this out:\n28 * (11 / 2) + 62 = 28 * 5.5 + 62 = 154 + 62 = 216\n\nThis is not equal to 81. The only option left is:\n\n28 + 11 * (62 / 2)\n\nCalculating this out:\n28 + 11 * (62 / 2) = 28 + 11 * 31 = 28 + 341 = 369\n\nThis is not equal to 81.

Dividing any of these numbers by 17 or 30 won't get us to 62 directly.\n\nLet's try a combination of addition and subtraction with multiplication:\n- We can subtract 17 from 62 to get 45.\n- We can try to get 45 using 49 and 30.\n\n49 - 30 = 19, which is close to 45. We need to add 26 to get to 45, but we don't have 26. Instead, we can use the multiplication of 17 * 3 = 51, which is close to 45. We need to adjust by subtracting 6 to get 45, but we don't have a 6.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n- We can use 49 - 17 = 32.\n- We need 30 more to reach 62.\n- We can use 30 directly.\n\nSo, 49 - 17 + 30 = 62.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 49 - 17 + 30 </answer>"}]

We can start by trying to simplify the problem and see if we can get close to 11.\n\nOne approach could be to use division, as it often reduces larger numbers to smaller ones. Let's try dividing 62 by 59:\n\n62 / 59 = 1.0339\n\nThis is close to 1, but not quite there. We still need to incorporate 10 and 2 to get to 11. We can add 10 and 2:\n\n10 + 2 = 12\n\nNow, we need to adjust this result to get 11. Since 12 is just 1 more than 11, we can subtract 1 from it. We already have 1.0339 from the division, which is close to 1. So, we can use 10 and 2 to get 12, and then subtract 1.0339 to get 11. However, we need to use the numbers exactly as given and not introduce a decimal.\n\nAnother approach could be to use subtraction. Let's try subtracting 2 from 10:\n\n10 - 2 = 8\n\nNow, we need to use 59 and 62 to get from 8 to 11. We can add 59 and 62, but that's too large. Instead, we can subtract 43 (which is 59 - 16) from the sum of 10 and 2:\n\n(10 + 2) - (59 - 62) = 12 - (-3) = 12 + 3 = 15\n\nThis is still not correct. Let's try another combination:\n\nWe can use 62 - 59 = 3, and then 10 - 3 = 7, and finally 7 + 4 = 11. But we need to use the numbers exactly as given.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\n(62 - 59) + (10 - 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nSo, the correct equation is:\n\n62 - 59 + 10 - 2 = 11\n</think>\n<answer> (62 - 59) + (10 - 2) </answer>"}]

Let's try 71 - (62 + 18 - 24):\n71 - (62 + 18 - 24) = 71 - (80 - 24) = 71 - 56 = 15, which is still not right.\n\nNow, let's try 71 - (62 + 24 - 18):\n71 - (62 + 24 - 18) = 71 - (86 - 18) = 71 - 68 = 3, this is close but still not right.\n\nIt seems we need to use 24 in a different way. Let's try 71 - (62 + 18) + 24:\n71 - (62 + 18) + 24 = 71 - 80 + 24 = -9 + 24 = 15, still not right.\n\nNow, let's try 71 - (62 - 18) + 24:\n71 - (62 - 18) + 24 = 71 - 44 + 24 = 27 + 24 = 51, this is correct!\n\nSo the equation is 71 - (62 - 18) + 24 = 51.\n</think>\n<answer>71 - (62 - 18) + 24</answer>"}]

(95 - 22) - (75 - 71) = 73 - 4 = 69 (not 73)\n2. (95 - 75) + (71 - 22) = 20 + 49 = 69 (not 73)\n3. (95 - 71) + 75 - 22 = 24 + 75 - 22 = 77 (not 73)\n4. (75 - 22) + (95 - 71) = 53 + 24 = 77 (not 73)\n5. (75 + 71 - 22) - 95 = 126 - 95 = 31 (not 73)\n6. (75 + 22) - (95 - 71) = 97 - 24 = 73 (this is it)\n\nThe combination (75 + 22) - (95 - 71) equals 73.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (75 + 22) - (95 - 71) </answer>"}]

Let's think through this step by step.\n<think>\nTo achieve 73 using the numbers 19, 6, and 48, we need to consider how these numbers can be combined using the basic arithmetic operations. Given the large difference between the numbers, multiplication seems like a likely candidate to get close to 73.\n\nFirst, we can try multiplying 48 by one of the other numbers:\n- \\(48 * 19 = 912\\) (too large)\n- \\(48 * 6 = 288\\) (also too large)\n\nSince multiplying 48 by either 19 or 6 results in a number that is too large, we should consider adding or subtracting the smaller numbers to adjust the result.\n\nNow, let's consider adding or subtracting 6 to/from the product of 48 and 19:\n- \\(912 - 6 = 906\\) (too large)\n- \\(912 + 6 = 918\\) (too large)\n\nGiven that these direct approaches are too large, we should consider a different combination. We can try to use 19 in a way that allows us to reach 73 through a combination of multiplication and addition or subtraction.\n\nIf we multiply 48 by 1 and then add 25, we get 73. But since we only have 19 and 6, we need to find a way to use these numbers to get to 25. We can use 6 and 19 to get to 25 by:\n- \\(19 + 6 = 25\\)\n\nSo, we can construct the equation as:\n- \\(48 * 1 + (19 + 6) = 48 * 1 + 25 = 48 + 25 = 73\\)\n\nHowever, we need to use the numbers exactly as given and only use them once. Let's try another approach:\n- \\(48 + 19 + 6 = 73\\)\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and achieves the target number 73.\n</think>\n<answer> 48 + 19 + 6 </answer>"}]

Let's explore different combinations.\n\n1. First, we might consider the fact that 73 is very close to 78, which gives us a hint that 78 might be a good starting point.\n\n2. If we subtract 61 from 78, we get 17. This leaves us with 78 and 12, and we need to find a way to get from 17 to 73.\n\n3. If we add 56 to 17, we get 73. This suggests we need to use 12 in a way that it equals 56 when combined with 78.\n\n4. 78 - 12 = 66, which is close to 56 but not quite there. We need to adjust.\n\n5. Instead, we can consider (78 - 12) and see if it fits into the equation. 78 - 12 = 66, and 66 - 9 = 57, which is close but not 56.\n\n6. A better approach is to use 78 and 12 to get 66, and then add something to 66 to get 73. If we subtract 3 from 66, we get 63, and if we add 10, we get 73.\n\n7. We can get 10 by using 61 - 61 + 12 - 2, but this is complex. A simpler approach is to use 61 - 12 + (78 - 78).\n\n8. This simplifies to 61 - 12 = 49, and 78 - 78 = 0, so the equation becomes 61 - 12 + 0 = 49, which is not 73.\n\n9. Finally, we can use 78 - 12 = 66, and 66 - 61 = 5, and 5 + 68 = 73. But this doesn't use the numbers given directly. \n\n10. The correct and simplest approach is to use 78 - (78 - 61) + 12 = 73. Let's verify this:\n    78 - (78 - 61) + 12 = 78 - 17 + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73.\n\nSo, the equation is 78 - (78 - 61) + 12.\n</think>\n<answer> 78 - (78 - 61) + 12 </answer>"}]

We can use division:\n   75 / 9 = 8.333 (not an integer, and not close to 72)\n   75 / 27 = 2.777 (not an integer, and not close to 72)\n   27 / 9 = 3, and then 75 - 3 = 72 (this seems promising)\n\nSo the equation would be: 75 - (27 / 9) = 72.\n</think>\n<answer> 75 - (27 / 9) </answer>"}]

We can also consider using multiplication and division in combination with addition or subtraction.\n\nOne approach is to use 45 and subtract a number from it to get close to 41. We can use 37 for this:\n45 - 37 = 8\n\nNow, we need to use 38 and 3 to adjust this to 41. If we add 3 to 8, we get 11, which is still too low. Let's try subtracting from 45 instead:\n45 - 38 = 7\n\nNow, we need to use 37 and 3 to get from 7 to 41. If we add 37 to 7, we get 44, which is close but not quite 41.

We can start by trying to get close to 40 using these numbers.\n\nOne approach could be to use subtraction or division to reduce a larger number to 40. Let's consider the possibility of 50 - some combination of the other numbers.\n\nIf we subtract 18 from 50, we get 32, which is close but still not 40. We need to add or subtract more to reach 40.\n\nNow, if we subtract 25 from 53, we get 28. If we add this to 32 (from 50 - 18), we get 60, which is too high.\n\nLet's try a different combination. We can use division to get closer. If we take 53 and divide it by 25, we get 2.12, which is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach could be to use multiplication. If we multiply 25 by 1.6, we get 40. But we don't have 1.6 as a direct number, so we need to find a way to create 1.6 using the given numbers.\n\nInstead, let's try to use 53 and 18 in a way that gets us close to 40 when combined with 50 and 25.\n\nIf we subtract 18 from 53, we get 35. Now, if we add this to 5 and then subtract 50, we don't get 40. But, if we add 18 to 53 and then subtract 25, we get 46. We are getting closer.\n\nLet's try another combination: 50 - (53 - 18) = 50 - 35 = 15. We are still not there.\n\nLet's try 50 - (53 - 25) = 50 - 28 = 22. Still not there.\n\nLet's try 50 - (25 - 18) = 50 - 7 = 43. Close, but not quite.\n\nFinally, let's try 50 - (53 - 18) + 25 = 50 - 35 + 25 = 40.

Trying to use 93 and 87 first:\n   - 93 - 87 = 6 (not 17)\n   - 93 / 87 is not an integer and does not result in 17\n\n2.

Considering addition and subtraction:\n   - 93 - 44 - 21 = 28 (not 17)\n   - 87 - 44 - 21 = 22 (not 17)\n\n7. Let's try using 44 and 21 with 93:\n   - 93 / (44 - 21) = 93 / 23 = 4 (not 17)\n\n8. Now, let's try 87 and 93 with 21:\n   - (93 - 87) * 21 = 6 * 21 = 126 (not 17)\n   - (87 - 93) * 21 = -6 * 21 = -126 (not 17)\n\n9.

Finally, let's try 44, 93, and 21:\n    - (93 - 44) / 21 = 49 / 21 = 2.33 (not 17)\n\nAfter checking all these combinations, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints and consider if there's a simpler solution or if we missed a key combination. The solution is actually straightforward if we consider the use of parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n(93 - 87) + (44 - 21) = 6 + 23 = 29 (not 17)\n\nThe correct solution is actually:\n(87 - 93) + 44 - 21 = -6 + 44 - 21 = 17\n</think>\n<answer> (87 - 93) + 44 - 21 </answer>"}]

If we use 88 and 20 in multiplication, the result would be 1760, which is too large.\n2. If we use 88 and 10 in multiplication, the result would be 880, which is also too large.\n3.

If we use 88 and 20 in addition, the result would be 108, which is too large.\n\nConsidering the results, we can see that the numbers need to be used in a way that allows for a significant reduction to reach 90. The key is to use division to reduce the large numbers.\n\nLet's try 88 / 8 (though 8 is not in the list, we can use 20 / 2.5 as a conceptual approach, but since we can only use the given numbers, we need to find a way to approach 2.5 with the given numbers).\n\nThe closest we can get is by dividing 88 by 20 and then using the result in further operations:\n88 / 20 = 4.4\n\nNow, we need to use 10 to reach 90:\n90 - 4.4 = 85.6\n\nHowever, this is not exact, so we need to find another approach. Let's try a different combination:\n\n88 - (20 / 10) = 88 - 2 = 86\n\nThis is closer, but still not 90.

We can try to use 50 as a base and adjust with the other numbers:\n   - 50 - 16 = 34 (too high)\n   - 50 - 32 = 18 (too low)\n   - 50 / 16 = 3.125 (not an integer, and too low)\n   - 50 / 32 = 1.5625 (not an integer, and too low)\n\n2. Next, we can try 32 as a multiplier or base:\n   - 32 * 16 = 512 (too high)\n   - 32 * 50 = 1600 (too high)\n\n3. Now, let's try division with 16:\n   - 16 / 50 = 0.32 (too low)\n   - 16 / 32 = 0.5 (too low)\n\n4.

Let's try:\n   - (50 - 16) / 2 = 34 / 2 = 17 (not 25)\n   - (50 - 32) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9 (not 25)\n   - (32 - 16) * 2 = 16 * 2 = 32 (not 25)\n\nThe correct approach is:\n   - (50 - 16) / 2 + 25 = 34 / 2 + 25 = 17 + 8 = 25\n\nSo, the equation is (50 - 16) / 2 + 25 = 25.\n\nHowever, we need to use the number 32.

We need to use the numbers 61, 62, 81, and 37 to get a result of 44.

We can try to find a combination where the result is close to 44 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nOne possible combination is:\n- Start with 61 and subtract 17 (which is not one of our numbers, so we need to find a way to get 17).\n\nAnother possible combination is:\n- Consider 81 - 37 = 44, but we need to use 61 and 62 in the equation as well.\n\nLet's see if we can use 61 and 62 in a way that gets us close to 44 when combined with the other two numbers.\n\nOne working combination is:\n- 62 - 61 = 1\n- 81 - 37 = 44\n\nSo, we can use 61 and 62 in a way that we get 1, and then use 81 - 37 to get 44.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n62 - 61 + (81 - 37)\n\nLet's check the arithmetic:\n62 - 61 = 1\n81 - 37 = 44\n1 + 44 = 45\n\nWe are one step away, but we can tweak it slightly:\n(62 - 61) * (81 - 37) = 1 * 44 = 44\n\nThis works perfectly.

Then we need to get to 27 by adding or subtracting 59 and 8. If we subtract 59 from 24, we get -35, which is not 27. However, if we add 59 and subtract 88, we get -29, which is not 27 either.

If we subtract 8 from 87, we get 79. We can use 10 and 81 to get 8. Since 81 - 10 = 71, we need to adjust this to get 8.

Since we don't have 2 directly, we can use 81 - 79 = 2, and then 10 - (81 - 79) to get 8.\n\nSo, we can form the equation: 87 - (10 - (81 - 79)).\n\nLet's simplify this:\n87 - (10 - 2) = 87 - 8 = 79.\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and uses basic arithmetic operations.\n</think>\n<answer> 87 - (10 - (81 - 79)) </answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n- First, I notice that 79 is the largest number, and it's difficult to make 52 with 79 directly, so we should try to subtract it.\n- If we subtract 79 from a larger number, we might get close to 52. The only way to get a larger number than 79 is to multiply 72 and 9, which gives 648.\n- Now, we need to find a way to use 36 to get to 52. If we subtract 36 from 648, we get 612, which is far from 52.\n- Another approach is to use 72 directly and see if we can adjust with the other numbers. If we subtract 72 from 9, we get -63, which is not helpful.\n- Let's try to use division. If we divide 72 by 9, we get 8. Adding 36 to 8 gives us 44, which is still not 52.\n- Finally, I realize that if we subtract 79 from 72 * 9, we get a value close to 52. Let's calculate: 72 * 9 = 648, and 648 - 79 = 569. This is too large, so we need to adjust.\n- The correct approach is to use 79 - (72 / 9) + 36. Let's calculate this step by step:\n  72 / 9 = 8\n  79 - 8 = 71\n  71 + 36 = 107\n- This is still not correct. Let's try another combination: 79 - (72 - 9) + 36 = 79 - 63 + 36 = 52.\n</think>\n<answer> 79 - (72 - 9) + 36 </answer>"}]

We need to figure out how to use the other numbers in a way that does not affect the value of 49.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the other numbers to create an expression that equals 1, and then multiply 49 by this expression.\n\nLet's try the following:\n(83 - 33 - 18) / 83 = (40 / 83)\n\nNow, we multiply 49 by this expression:\n49 * (40 / 83)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n(49 * 40) / 83\n\n49 * 40 = 1960\n1960 / 83 = 23.614457831325302\n\nThis is not 49, so let's try a different approach.

However, we can't just add 2 directly as we need to use other numbers as well.\n\nNext, let's consider the remaining numbers 49 and 50. We can use 50 to create a number close to 2, like 50 - 48. But we don't have a 48. Instead, we can use 49 - 47 to get 2, but we don't have a 47 either.\n\nConsidering the operations, we can use division or subtraction to create a 2 from 50. Let's try:\n\n50 - 48 = 2 (but we don't have 48)\n50 / 25 = 2 (but we don't have 25)\n\nAnother approach is to try to get 2 using 49 and 50 directly:\n\n(50 - 48) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4 (which is not 2)\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n(50 - 49) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nThis works.

First, let's try to use 98 and 52 in a way that could give us a number in the vicinity of 76. The most straightforward way is to subtract one from the other, as 98 - 52 = 46, which is too low. \n2.

You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n<think>\nTo solve this, we need to use the four numbers provided (27, 33, 71, 73) to form an equation that equals 21. We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nOne approach is to consider that the larger numbers (71 and 73) should ideally be involved in a subtraction to get a smaller number, and then we can add or subtract the remaining numbers to reach 21. \n\nLet's try: \n1. Start with 73 and 71. If we subtract 71 from 73, we get 2.\n2. Now we need to use 27 and 33 to get to 21. If we subtract 33 from 27, we get -6.\n3. We can combine these results: (73 - 71) * (27 - 33) = 2 * -6 = -12, which is not 21.\n4. Another approach could be to use division: (73 - 71) * (27 / 33). However, 27 / 33 is not an integer, so this won't work.\n5. Let's try a different combination: (73 - 71) * 27 - 33. This simplifies to 2 * 27 - 33 = 54 - 33 = 21.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (73 - 71) * 27 - 33 </answer>"}]

If we divide 69 by 58, we get approximately 1.19, which is far from 18. Similarly, 69 divided by 17 is approximately 4.06, which is also not 18.\n5. Now, let's try a combination of addition and division. If we divide 92 by 58, we get approximately 1.586, which is closer but still not 18. But if we multiply 1.586 by 69, we get approximately 109.194, which is far from 18.\n6. Let's try another combination: 92 divided by 58 is 1.586, and when we add 17 to it, we get approximately 18.586, which is close but not exact.\n7. Finally, let's try 92 / (58 - 17). This gives us 92 / 41, which equals 2.244, and when we multiply that by 17, we get approximately 38.148, which is still not 18.\n8. Let's try the combination 69 - 51, which is 18. But we need to use 17 and 92. We can use 92 - 74, which is 18, but we need to use 17 and 58.\n9. The correct combination is 92 - (58 - 17), which simplifies to 92 - 41 = 51, and then 69 - 51 = 18.\n\nSo, the correct equation is 69 - (92 - 58 + 17).\n</think>\n<answer> 69 - (92 - 58 + 17) </answer>"}]
