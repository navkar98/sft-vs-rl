If we divide 99 by 66, we get approximately 1.5, which is not very useful. \n\nNext, let's try subtraction. If we subtract 66 from 99, we get 33, which is far from 54. \n\nWe can try combining the numbers in a different way. Let's consider the possibility of using 87 in a way that it can help us reach 54.\n\nIf we subtract 99 from 87, we get -12, which is not helpful. \n\nIf we subtract 66 from 87, we get 21, still not 54.\n\nLet's try another approach. If we subtract 87 from 99, we get 12. Now, if we can use 66 in a way that it helps us reach 54, we can multiply 12 by 66 and then divide by 12, but that doesn't seem to be the right path.\n\nWe need to think more creatively. If we consider the possibility of using 87 in a way that it can help us reach 54, we can subtract 66 from 87 to get 21 and then add 33, which we can get by subtracting 66 from 99. However, this approach is complex.\n\nA simpler approach is to consider if we can use the numbers directly in a way that they sum up to 54. \n\nIf we subtract 99 from 153 (which is 87 + 66), we get 54.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 87 + 66 - 99 = 54.\n</think>\n<answer> 87 + 66 - 99 </answer>"}]

Let's consider the operations and combinations:\n\n1. Try simple additions and subtractions first.\n2.

However, we can't use 13 again, so we need to find another way.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n33 + 27 + 13 = 73\n\nSo, the equation is 33 + 27 + 13 = 73.</think>\n<answer>33 + 27 + 13</answer>"}]

Multiplication could be a factor, but it might not help us get to 13 exactly without leaving a remainder or needing a number not in the list.\n3.

First, let's try to use division or subtraction, as they can reduce the numbers more effectively.\n2. We can start by considering 98 as a potential number to divide or subtract by.\n3. If we subtract 23 from 98, we get 75, which is close but not 42.\n4. If we divide 98 by 23, we get approximately 4.26, which is close but not 42.\n5. If we use 79, we can try subtracting it from a combination of 98 and 23.\n6. Let's try 98 - 23 = 75, and then 75 - 79 = -4, which is not 42.\n7. Another approach is to use 98 - 79 = 19, and then we need to find a way to get to 42 using 23.\n8. We can multiply 19 by 23, but that gives us 437, which is too large.\n9. Instead, let's try using 23 and 79 together in a way that will help us reach 42.\n10. If we subtract 23 from 79, we get 56. Now, we need to get from 56 to 42 by using 98.\n11. We can subtract 98 from 56, but that gives us -42, which is not what we want.\n12. We can try another combination: (98 - 79) * 23 = 19 * 23, which we already know is not 42.\n13. Finally, let's try 98 - (79 - 23). This gives us 98 - 56 = 42.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 98 - (79 - 23).\n</think>\n<answer> 98 - (79 - 23) </answer>"}]

Let's consider the operations and how they can be used to reach 48.\n\nFirst, let's try to use 66 as a base and see if we can adjust it with 22 and 4 to get 48.\n66 - x = 48, so x = 66 - 48 = 18. But we don't have a 18, so this approach isn't working.\n\nNow, let's consider multiplication or division.

But this gives us a hint to use 4 as a divisor.\n\nNow, let's use 4 as a divisor and see if we can make it work:\n66 / 4 = 16.5, and we need to use 22 to get closer to 48.\n16.5 + 22 = 38.5, which is still not 48.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n66 - 22 = 44, and we need to use 4 to get to 48.\n44 + 4 = 48, which works perfectly.\n\nSo the equation is 66 - 22 + 4 = 48.\n</think>\n<answer> 66 - 22 + 4 </answer>"}]

Then, we need to find a way to use 99 to get to 15. We can do this by dividing 52 by 99 and then adjusting with the remaining number (99).\n\nHowever, a simpler approach might be to directly use these numbers in a combination that gets us to 15.\n\nNotice that if we subtract 16 from 99, we get 83. Then, if we subtract 68 from 83, we get 15. This works because:\n\n99 - 68 - 16 = 15\n\nSo, the equation is 99 - 68 - 16 = 15.\n</think>\n<answer> 99 - 68 - 16 </answer>"}]

Let's work through the possible combinations:\n\n1. First, we can try to use subtraction, as it often helps when the target number (26) is smaller than one of the given numbers. We start by subtracting 55 from 48:\n   48 - 55 = -7, which is not useful as it's too far from 26.\n\n2. Next, we can consider using division, but since 26 is not a simple divisor of any pair of the given numbers, this approach seems less likely to be successful.\n\n3. We then try to use addition and multiplication:\n   - Adding 48 and 19 gives 67, which is too high.\n   - Multiplying 48 by 19 gives 912, which is too high.\n   - Multiplying 55 by 48 or 19 results in even larger numbers.\n\n4. Let's reconsider our approach and try to use subtraction in a different way. We can try to use subtraction to get closer to 26:\n   - 55 - 48 = 7, which is close but not enough.\n   - 55 - 19 = 36, which is a bit far.\n   - 48 - 19 = 29, which is close but not enough.\n\n5. Now, let's consider combining subtraction with multiplication or division:\n   - (48 - 19) * 1 = 29, which is close but not enough.\n   - (55 - 48) * 19 = 143, which is too high.\n   - (55 - 19) * 48 = 1824, which is too high.\n\n6. Finally, let's try using division in conjunction with subtraction:\n   - (55 - 48) / 19 = 7 / 19, which is too small.\n   - (55 - 19) / 48 = 36 / 48 = 3 / 4, which is too small.\n   - (48 - 19) / 55 = 29 / 55, which is too small.\n\n7. After trying various combinations, we see that the most promising approach is to use subtraction and then add the result to 19:\n   - 55 - 48 = 7\n   - 7 + 19 = 26\n\nThus, the equation that uses the numbers 48, 19, and 55 to equal 26 is:\n<answer> (55 - 48) + 19 </answer>"}]

Then add 38 to 30, we get 68, which is too high.\n\nLet's try 46 - 38, which equals 8. Then add 16, we get 24, which is too low.\n\nAnother approach is to use multiplication.

If we subtract 45 from 88, we get 43. Now we need to use the remaining numbers (19 and 45) to reduce this result to 17.\n5. Using 45 again isn't feasible as it's larger than 43, so we need to use 19.\n6. We can subtract 19 from 43 to get 24, and then use the remaining 45 to further reduce it.\n7. Subtracting 45 from 24 would result in a negative number, so we need to rethink.\n8. A better approach is to divide 45 by 2.7 (which is close to 16.67) to get approximately 16.67, and then add 19 - 2.7 to get 17.\n9. We can achieve this by using 45 / (45 - 19) = 45 / 26 \u2248 1.73, but we need an exact solution.\n10. Another approach is to use 88 - 45 - 45 + 19 = 17.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 88 - 45 - 45 + 19 </answer>"}]

Let's try a combination of multiplication and addition: 54 * 2 + 14 = 118 + 14 = 132 (which is still too high)\n\nFrom these attempts, it seems we need to subtract one of the numbers to get closer to 94. Let's try subtracting 14 from a product involving 54:\n\n5. 54 * 2 - 14 = 108 - 14 = 94\n\nThis works. So the final equation is 54 * 2 - 14.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 54 * 2 - 14 </answer>"}]

If we use 70 - 82, we get -12, which is not helpful.\n\nNow let's try multiplication and division:\n\n1. If we use 82 * 70, we get 5740, which is too large.\n2. If we use 82 * 71, we get 5802, which is too large.\n3. If we use 70 * 71, we get 4970, which is too large.\n4. If we use 70 / 71, we get approximately 0.986, which is too small.\n5. If we use 70 / 82, we get approximately 0.854, which is too small.\n6. If we use 71 / 82, we get approximately 0.866, which is too small.\n\nNow, let's try combining addition and subtraction:\n\n1. If we use 82 - 70 + 71, we get 83, which is too large.\n2. If we use 82 + 70 - 71, we get 81, which is perfect.\n\nSo, the equation is 82 + 70 - 71 = 81.\n</think>\n<answer> 82 + 70 - 71 </answer>"}]

Subtracting 76 from 122 gives us 46, which is not 50.\n- If we add 76 and 4, we get 80. Subtracting 67 from 80 gives us 13, which is not 50.\n- If we add 67 and 4, we get 71. Subtracting 55 from 71 gives us 16, which is not 50.\n- If we add 55 and 4, we get 59. Subtracting 67 from 59 gives us -8, which is not 50.\n\nFinally, let's try a combination involving multiplication:\n- If we multiply 67 and 4, we get 268. Subtracting 76 from 268 gives us 192, which is not 50.\n- If we multiply 76 and 4, we get 304. Subtracting 67 from 304 gives us 237, which is not 50.\n- If we multiply 55 and 4, we get 220. Subtracting 67 from 220 gives us 153, which is not 50.\n\nAfter several attempts, it seems we need to reconsider the approach. Let's try:\n- If we multiply 67 and 4, we get 268. Now, if we subtract 55 from 268, we get 213, which is not 50.\n- If we multiply 76 and 4, we get 304. Now, if we subtract 55 from 304, we get 249, which is not 50.\n\nAfter further consideration, the correct approach seems to be:\n- If we add 67 and 55, we get 122. Now, if we subtract 76 from 122, we get 46. Finally, if we add 4 to 46, we get 50.\n\nSo the equation is: (67 + 55 - 76) + 4 = 50.\n</think>\n<answer> (67 + 55 - 76) + 4 </answer>"}]

Let's try:\n- 14 + 8 - 15 = 7 (too low)\n\nThe correct approach is:\n- 14 - 8 + 35 / 7\n\nFirst, perform the division:\n- 35 / 7 = 5\n\nThen, perform the addition and subtraction:\n- 14 - 8 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 (still not 20)\n\nFinally, the correct equation is:\n- 8 * 2.5\n\nBut since we can only use the provided numbers, the correct equation is:\n- 8 * (35 / 14) = 8 * 2.5 = 20\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n8 * (35 / 14) = 20\n<answer> 8 * (35 / 14) </answer>"}]

If we subtract 2 from 95, we get 93, which is far from 10.\n2. If we divide 95 by 2, we get 47.5, which is also far from 10.\n3. If we subtract 83 from 95, we get 12, which is close but not 10.\n4. If we divide 83 by 95, we get a very small number, which isn't helpful.\n5. If we subtract 83 from 2, we get -81, which is not useful.\n6. If we add 2 to 83, we get 85, which is also not close to 10.\n\nGiven these attempts, it seems we need to use a combination involving division. Let's try using 83 and 2 in a division operation and see if we can get a useful result with 95.\n\nIf we divide 2 by 83, we get a very small number, which isn't helpful. \n\nNow, let's try another approach: Using 95 and 2, and see if we can use 83 in a way that balances the equation to 10.\n\nIf we divide 95 by 83, we get approximately 1.145, which is close to 1 when subtracted by 2. This could work if we can adjust it to 10.\n\nSo, the equation would be: \n(95 / 83) - 2 = -0.855, which is not 10.\n\nRevisiting the problem, let's try a different combination:\nIf we use 95 - 83, we get 12, and then we need to adjust it to 10. We can use 2 in a way that balances it:\n(95 - 83) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nThus, the equation is:\n95 - 83 - 2 = 10.\n</think>\n<answer> 95 - 83 - 2 </answer>"}]

Let's work through the problem step-by-step to find an equation that uses the numbers [75, 19, 66, 78] to equal 88, using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.\n\n1. **Identify the goal and constraints**:\n   - We need to use the numbers 75, 19, 66, and 78 exactly once.\n   - We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n2. **Experiment with combinations**:\n   - Let's start by trying to use the largest numbers to get close to 88, as they will give us more flexibility in the operations.\n\n3. **Testing potential equations**:\n   - Consider 75 + 13 = 88. We need to get 13 from the remaining numbers.\n   - 19 - 6 = 13. So, we can use 19 and 66 (19 - 66/66 = 19 - 1 = 18, but we need 13, so we adjust).\n   - Another approach: 75 - 7 = 68, and 68 + 20 = 88. We need to get 20 from 19 and 66.\n   - 66 - 46 = 20, but we don't have 46. Instead, consider 78 - 19 = 59, and 59 + 29 = 88. We need to get 29 from 66 and 75.\n   - 75 - 46 = 29, and 66 - 37 = 29. We can use 66 - (78 - 12) = 66 - 66 + 12 = 12, and then 78 - 66 = 12.\n   - We need a simpler and more direct approach.\n\n4. **Finding the simplest solution**:\n   - Let's try: 75 - 7 = 68, and 68 + 20 = 88. We need 20 from 19 and 66.\n   - 66 - 46 = 20, and we need 46. Consider 78 - 32 = 46, but we can use 78 - (66 - 19) = 78 - 47 = 31, and 31 - 3 = 28, but that's not 46.\n   - Simplify: 75 - 7 = 68, and 68 + 20 = 88. We need 20 from 66 and 19.\n   - 66 - 46 = 20, and 46 = 78 - 32. We can use 78 - (66 - 19) = 78 - 47 = 31, and 31 - 3 = 28, but that's not 46.\n   - Correct approach: 75 - 7 = 68, and 68 + 20 = 88. We need 20 from 66 and 19.\n   - 66 - 46 = 20, and 46 = 78 - 32. We can use 78 - (66 - 19) = 78 - 47 = 31, and 31 - 3 = 28, but that's not 46.\n\n5. **Final solution**:\n   - 75 - 7 = 68, and 68 + 20 = 88. We need 20 from 66 and 19.\n   - 66 - 46 = 20, and 46 = 78 - 32. We can use 78 - (66 - 19) = 78 - 47 = 31, and 31 - 3 = 28, but that's not 46.\n\n   After several attempts, the simplest and correct approach is:\n   \\[\n   78 - 75 + 19 = 22\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   66 + 22 = 88\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final equation is:\n<answer> 66 + (78 - 75 + 19) </answer>"}]

Trying 87 - 5 - 20 = 62 (not 13)\n9. Trying 87 / (20 - 5) = 87 / 15 = 5.8 (not 13)\n10. Trying 20 - 5 * (87 - 100) = 20 - 5 * -13 = 20 + 65 = 85 (not 13)\n\nFinally, we find:\n11. Trying 20 - 87 / 5 = 20 - 17.4 = 2.6 (not 13)\n12. Trying 5 * 20 - 87 = 100 - 87 = 13 (this works)\n\nSo, the equation that uses the numbers 5, 20, and 87 exactly once to equal 13 is 5 * 20 - 87.\n</think>\n<answer> 5 * 20 - 87 </answer>"}]

Multiplying 14 and 5 gives 70, which is close but not exactly 54. Dividing 35 by 5 gives 7, which is too small.\n\nNext, let's try using addition and subtraction with 14, 35, and 5. If we add 35 and 14, we get 49. To get to 54, we need to add 5, but we've already used 5. So, let's subtract 5 from 49 instead to see if we can adjust.\n\n49 - 5 = 44, which is still not 54. Let's try another combination.\n\nIf we add 35 and 5, we get 40. Adding 14 to 40 gives us 54. This looks promising.\n\nSo, the equation using the numbers 14, 35, and 5 that equals 54 is 35 + 5 + 14.</think>\n<answer>35 + 5 + 14</answer>"}]

We can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nFirst, let's consider the multiplication and division:\n- 98 is a large number, and dividing it by another number might not get us close to 22.\n- Multiplying 86 by another number would likely result in a number larger than 22.\n\nNext, let's consider subtraction:\n- Subtracting a smaller number from a larger number might help us get to 22.\n\nFinally, let's consider addition:\n- Adding a small number to a large number might help us reach 22.\n\nGiven these considerations, we might try to subtract a smaller number from a larger one and then adjust with the remaining number.\n\nLet's try:\n(86 - 98) * 34\n\nThis would be:\n(-12) * 34 = -408\n\nThis is not correct.

But this doesn't directly work as we need to use all numbers in one equation.\n\nA simpler and correct approach is to subtract 28 from 74 to get 46 and then subtract 1 to get 45:\n\n74 - 28 - 1 = 45\n\nThis fits all the criteria, using each number exactly once and using basic arithmetic operations. \n\nTherefore, the equation is 74 - 28 - 1 = 45.\n</think>\n<answer>74 - 28 - 1</answer>"}]

We start with the three numbers: 84, 10, and 97.\n2. Considering the large numbers (84 and 97), we need to use them in a way that they can be reduced to a smaller number close to 23.\n3. A potential approach is to use subtraction or division with these larger numbers.\n4. Let's try subtracting 10 from 97: 97 - 10 = 87. Now we need to use 84 to get to 23.\n5. If we divide 87 by 84, we get a number less than 1, which won't help. So, we need to subtract or add some other way.\n6. Another approach is to use 84 in a way that it can be a divisor or divisor part. If we divide 84 by 10, we get 8.4, which is closer but not exact.\n7. Consider the equation: 97 - 84 / 10. First, 84 / 10 = 8.4. Then, 97 - 8.4 = 88.6, which is too large.\n8. Another idea: Use 10 in a way that it can help reduce the larger numbers. If we subtract 10 from 84, we get 74. Now, we need to use 97.\n9. A working solution might be: 97 - 74. But we need to use 10 somehow. Let's try: 97 - (84 - 10) = 97 - 74 = 23.\n\nThus, the equation is: 97 - (84 - 10) = 23.\n\n<answer> 97 - (84 - 10) </answer>"}]

If we divide 21 by 37, we get a fraction, which isn't 16. \n\nSo, let's try subtracting 37 from 90 - 69. \n\n90 - 69 = 21\n21 - 37 = -16 (which is not the solution)\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n90 - (69 - 37) = 90 - 32 = 58 (too large)\n\n(90 - 69) / 37 = 21 / 37 (too small)\n\n(90 - 37) - 69 = 53 - 69 = -16 (not the solution)\n\n(90 / 37) - 69 = 2.43 - 69 (not the solution)\n\n37 - (90 - 69) = 37 - 21 = 16 (this works!)\n\nSo, the equation using the numbers 90, 37, 69 to get 16 is 37 - (90 - 69). </think>\n<answer> 37 - (90 - 69) </answer>"}]

We need to adjust this.\n\nLet's use 67 - (4/4) * 4, which simplifies to 67 - 4 = 63, still too large.\n\nFinally, we can use: 67 - (4 * 4) = 67 - 16 = 51.\n\nThis gives us the required result using all three numbers exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.\n</think>\n<answer> 67 - (4 * 4) </answer>"}]

One approach is to use subtraction to get closer to 68. For instance, 78 - 75 = 3, which is far from 68. We need to use the other numbers effectively.\n\n2. Let's try to use division or multiplication to get a number closer to 68.\n\n3. If we divide 44 by 75, we get a small number, which won't help much in reaching 68.\n\n4. Multiplying 41 by 44 gives 1804, which is too large.\n\n5. Let's use 75 and 41. If we subtract 41 from 75, we get 34. Now, we need to use 78 and 44 to get to 68.\n\n6. If we add 78 to 44, we get 122. We need to subtract something to get to 68.\n\n7. To get from 122 to 68, we need to subtract 54. Using 78 - 75 = 3, we can adjust this to get the required 54 by multiplying 3 by 18, but we don't have a 18.\n\n8. Another approach is to use 78 and 44 together. We can subtract 44 from 78 to get 34 and then add 34 to 34 (which we can get by subtracting 41 from 75) to get 68.\n\nSo, the equation is: (78 - 44) + (75 - 41) = 68\n</think>\n<answer> (78 - 44) + (75 - 41) </answer>"}]

Since the goal is to end up with 95, we should consider how these operations can be combined to reach this number.\n\nLet's start with the numbers and see if we can find a combination that works:\n- 28 + 70 + 38 = 136 (too high)\n- 28 + 70 - 38 = 60 (too low)\n- 28 + 70 * 38 = 28 + 2660 = 2688 (way too high)\n- 70 + 28 * 38 = 70 + 1064 = 1134 (way too high)\n- 38 + 70 * 28 = 38 + 1960 = 1998 (way too high)\n\nNow, let's try division and see if we can get closer:\n- 70 + 38 - 28 = 80 (too low)\n- 70 + 28 - 38 = 60 (too low)\n- 70 - 28 + 38 = 80 (too low)\n\nThe most promising combination seems to be using multiplication and addition/subtraction.

Given the significant difference between the numbers, multiplication or division might be necessary to get close to 96.\n\n- Multiplying 44 by 2 gives 88, which is close to 96. However, we don't have a 2 to multiply with.\n- Multiplying 13 by 4 gives 52, which is further from 96.\n- Adding 13 to 44 gives 57, still not close to 96.\n\nGiven these constraints, we should consider using division to scale down 44 to a useful number.

But since we already used 4 in the division, we need to find an alternative.\n\nLet's try another approach: Using 44 and 13, we can get 44 + 13 = 57. To get from 57 to 96, we need to add 39. We can get 39 using 44 - 5 (where 5 is 4 + 1, but we don't have a 1, so we need to rethink).\n\nA simpler approach is to use 44 and 13 to get a number close to 96, and then use division to adjust. Let's try 44 * 2 = 88, and then add 13 - 1 = 12 to get 88 + 12 = 100. Since we don't have a 1, we need to find another way.\n\nAnother way is: 44 + 13 * 4 = 44 + 52 = 96.

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. Trying to combine 69 and 75 first is challenging since the difference or quotient is not easily manipulable to 24.\n2. Looking at 30, we can try to use it in a way that the result is close to 24 when combined with 69 or 75.\n\nOne approach is to use 75 - 30 to get 45, but then we need to find a way to use 69 to approach 24.\n\nAnother approach is to use 69 - 75, which gives -6, and then try to use 30, but this seems less likely to get to 24.\n\nConsidering multiplication, 69 * 30 is too large, and 69 * 75 is also too large.\n\nLet's try division and addition/subtraction:\n- If we divide 75 by 30, we get 2.5. We then need to use 69 in a way that when combined with 2.5, we get 24.\n- 69 - 2.5 = 66.5, which is too large.\n- 69 * 2.5 = 172.5, which is too large.\n- 69 / 2.5 = 27.6, which is close but not exactly 24.\n\nGiven these trials, let's try a different combination:\n- If we use 75 - 30, we get 45. Now we need to use 69 in a way that when combined with 45, we get 24. This doesn't seem feasible.\n\nAnother approach:\n- If we use 30 - 69, we get -39. We need to use 75 in a way that when combined with -39, we get 24. This also doesn't seem feasible.\n\nFinally, let's try a direct approach:\n- 75 - 69 = 6\n- 6 + 30 = 36, which is too large.\n\nLet's try:\n- 75 - 30 = 45\n- 69 - 45 = 24\n\nThis seems to work.

Another approach is to see if we can use 61 - 3 = 58 and then adjust with 45 and 47, but that seems too complex.\n5. A simpler approach is to use 61 - 3 and then adjust with 45 and 47 directly.

It's clear that 67 is too large, so we'll use 18. To get 23 from 18, we need to add:\n\n18 + 5 = 23\n\nBut 5 is not in our set of numbers. So, we need to think of another way to use 18 and 67 to get 23. Let's try to use 18 and 67 in a multiplication or division that could result in 23. However, that doesn't seem straightforward, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of using 67 and 76 in a way that brings us closer to 72 when combined with 18.

We can add 18 to 9 to get 27, which is still far from 72. \n\nLet's reconsider the initial subtraction:\n99 - 76 = 23\n\nAnd try to use 18 to get close to 72:\n72 - 23 = 49\n\nNow, we can use 67 and 18 to get 49:\n67 - 18 = 49\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n99 - 76 + 67 - 18 = 72\n\nLet's verify:\n99 - 76 = 23\n23 + 67 = 90\n90 - 18 = 72\n\nThis works. Therefore, the equation is:\n99 - 76 + 67 - 18 = 72\n</think>\n<answer> 99 - 76 + 67 - 18 </answer>"}]

Multiplying 88 and 70 gives 6160, which is far from 24, so multiplication is not a useful operation here.\n- Next, let's try dividing 88 or 70 by 6. 88 / 6 is approximately 14.67, and 70 / 6 is approximately 11.67, neither of which gives 24.\n- Let's consider 68 and 70 as a sum. 88 - 70 = 18, which is still not 24.\n- Now, let's try some combination involving addition and subtraction. If we add 6 to 88, we get 94, which is still far from 24. If we subtract 6 from 88, we get 82, which is also not 24.\n- We need to get closer to 24. If we take 88 and subtract 66, we get 22.

Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nTo create an equation that equals 43 using the numbers [98, 72, 4, 68] exactly once, we can start by trying different combinations and arithmetic operations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the largest number, 98, and see if we can reduce it to a value close to 43 using the other numbers. One approach is to subtract a value from 98.\n\nIf we subtract 68 from 98, we get:\n98 - 68 = 30\n\nNow we need to get from 30 to 43. We can use the remaining numbers 72 and 4. If we add 13 to 30, we get 43. We can achieve this by dividing 72 by 4:\n72 / 4 = 18\n\nSo, we can combine these steps to form the equation:\n98 - 68 + 72 / 4\n\nLet's verify:\n98 - 68 = 30\n72 / 4 = 18\n30 + 18 = 48\n\nIt seems we need to adjust since 48 is not 43. Let's try another combination.\n\nConsider:\n98 - 72 = 26\n26 + 4 = 30\n30 + 13 = 43\n\nWe need to find a way to get 13 using 68 and 4.

Let's try:\n68 - 4 = 64\n64 / 4 = 16\n\nNow we can combine:\n98 - 72 + 16 = 43\n\nSo, the equation is:\n98 - 72 + 68 / 4\n\nFinal answer: <answer> 98 - 72 + 68 / 4 </answer>"}]
