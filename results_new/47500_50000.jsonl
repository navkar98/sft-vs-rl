Let's consider the operations and the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider if we can use 52 in the equation. Since 52 is significantly larger than 29, we need to subtract a number from it to get close to 29. The closest number to 23 (52 - 29) is 20. So, we can use 52 - 20 and then manipulate the remaining numbers (25 and 18) to get 23.\n\nLet's try the equation: 52 - 20 - (18 - 25).\n\n- 52 - 20 = 32\n- 18 - 25 = -7\n- 32 - (-7) = 32 + 7 = 39\n\nThis equation does not work, so let's try another combination.\n\nNext, let's try 52 - 25 and then manipulate the remaining numbers (20 and 18) to get close to 29 - 27 (52 - 25).\n\nLet's try the equation: 52 - 25 + (20 - 18).\n\n- 52 - 25 = 27\n- 20 - 18 = 2\n- 27 + 2 = 29\n\nThis equation works.

We can use 79 in the following way:\n\\[ 79 - 50 = 29 \\]\n\\[ 29 - 11 = 18 \\]\nThis is not working. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe can use:\n\\[ 50 - 11 = 39 \\]\n\\[ 79 - 39 = 40 \\]\nThis works. So the equation is:\n\\[ 79 - (50 - 11) = 40 \\]\n\nLet's verify:\n\\[ 79 - 39 = 40 \\]\nThis is correct.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n<answer> 79 - (50 - 11) </answer>"}]

However, let's consider a more complex combination:\n- (95 - 62) + (39 - 18) = 33 + 21 = 54, which is too large.\n- (95 - 62) - (39 - 18) = 33 - 21 = 12, which is exactly 12.\n\nThis combination works: (95 - 62) - (39 - 18) = 12.\n\n</think>\n<answer> (95 - 62) - (39 - 18) </answer>"}]

Let's think through the steps:\n\nTo solve this, we need to find a way to combine the numbers 98, 26, and 35 using the basic operations to get 37. We can approach this by trying different combinations:\n\n1. First, let's see if we can use subtraction or division to get close to 37:\n   - If we subtract 35 from 98, we get 63, which is too high.\n   - Dividing 98 by 26 gives us approximately 3.77, which is far from 37.\n   - Dividing 35 by 26 gives us approximately 1.35, which is also far from 37.\n\n2. Let's try adding and subtracting:\n   - If we subtract 26 from 98, we get 72, still too high.\n   - Subtracting 35 from 72 gives us 37, but we haven't used 98 yet.\n   - We can also try 98 - 35 = 63, and then 63 - 26 = 37, but we're using 98 twice, which is not allowed.\n\n3. Another combination might be:\n   - If we divide 98 by 26, we get approximately 3.77, which is close to 37 - 4.\n   - 98 / 26 = 3.769, and 37 - 3.769 = 33.231, which is not working.\n\n4. Simplifying further:\n   - We need to get 37 from a combination of these numbers. The only way seems to be using subtraction:\n   - 98 - 61 = 37, and 61 can be derived from 26 + 35.\n\nSo, the equation that equals 37 using the numbers [98, 26, 35] is 98 - (26 + 35).\n\n<answer> 98 - (26 + 35) </answer>"}]

First, let's identify the numbers we have: 11, 15, and 5.\n2. We need to use these numbers exactly once and achieve the result of 40 using basic arithmetic operations.\n3. We can start by trying to use multiplication or division to get close to 40, since 40 is a relatively large number.\n4. Multiplying 11 and 5 gives us 55. This is close to 40, but we still have the number 15 unused.\n5. To get from 55 to 40, we can subtract 15. So, the equation would be 11 * 5 - 15.\n6. Let's verify: 11 * 5 = 55, and 55 - 15 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the equation that uses the numbers [11, 15, 5] exactly once and equals 40 is 11 * 5 - 15.\n\n<answer> 11 * 5 - 15 </answer>"}]

Since 88 is too large, we can subtract it from another number or use it in a way that brings us closer to 39.\n\nOne approach could be to use 88 and 45, as 88 - 45 = 43, which is close to 39.\n\nNow, we need to use 67 and 15 somehow. If we subtract 15 from 67, we get 52, which is too large. However, if we can use 15 in a way that reduces our result from 43 to 39, we might be on the right track.\n\nIf we subtract 15 from 43, we get 28, which is still too large. But if we consider the possibility of division or other operations, we can try:\n\n(88 - 45) - (67 - 15) = 43 - 52 = -9 (This doesn't work)\n\nAnother approach is to use multiplication or addition.

We can do this by subtracting 43 - 52 + 15, but in a more simplified form:\n\n45 - (67 - 15) = 45 - 52 = -7 (This doesn't work)\n\nFinally, let's try a different combination:\n\n88 - 67 = 21\n45 - 15 = 30\n21 + 30 - 12 = 39 (This seems promising)\n\nNow, let's check if we can use the numbers in a single equation:\n\n(88 - 67) + (45 - 15) = 21 + 30 = 51 (Still not 39)\n\nAfter trying several combinations, I realize that a more direct approach is needed.

I'll start by trying to use the largest number, 55, since it's close to 60.\n\nIf I add 22 to 55, I get 77, which is too large.

If I divide 55 by 22, I get 2.5, which is too small.\n\nNow, let's try a combination of operations. If I subtract 17 from 60, I get 43. I can try to get 43 using the numbers 55 and 22.\n\nIf I subtract 22 from 55, I get 33. Now, if I add 10 to 33, I get 43. I can achieve this by dividing 55 by 5, which is 11, and then subtracting 17 from 22, which is 5. So, I can use (55 / 5) - (17 - 22).\n\nSimplifying the expression, I get: (55 / 5) - (-5) = 11 + 5 = 16, which is not equal to 60.\n\nI need to re-evaluate the approach. Instead of trying to get 43, let's try to get 60 directly using a combination of the numbers.\n\nIf I add 17 and 22, I get 39. Now, if I add 21 to 39, I get 60. I can get 21 by subtracting 5 from 26. Since I don't have 26, I can try to get 5 by subtracting 22 from 27. But I don't have 27 either.\n\nLet's try another combination: If I subtract 17 from 55, I get 38.

We can't use 50 directly to reach 10, as 50 is too large.\n2. We can consider using 30 and 30 in some combination to get a number that when combined with 50 gives us 10.\n3. One approach is to subtract 50 from a product or sum of 30 and 30.\n4. Trying 30 - (30 / 50) would be too small.\n5. Trying 30 * (30 / 50) would be close, but would result in 18, which is not our goal.\n6. A useful approach is to use division and subtraction in a way to reduce the size of the numbers effectively.\n\nConsidering these points, let's try 30 - (30 / 50 * 30).\n\nStep-by-step:\n1.

However, we can use the numbers in a more complex way. Let's try a combination:\n\n\\[ (71 - 41) \\times 12 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\\[ 71 - 41 = 30 \\]\n\nNext, multiply the result by 12:\n\\[ 30 \\times 12 = 360 \\]\n\nThis is not 100, so let's try another combination:\n\n\\[ 71 - (41 - 12) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\\[ 41 - 12 = 29 \\]\n\nNext, subtract this result from 71:\n\\[ 71 - 29 = 42 \\]\n\nThis is also not 100, so another attempt:\n\n\\[ 71 - \\left( \\frac{41}{12} \\right) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the division:\n\\[ \\frac{41}{12} \\approx 3.4167 \\]\n\nThen, subtract this from 71:\n\\[ 71 - 3.4167 \\approx 67.5833 \\]\n\nThis is still not 100.

Given the numbers, it's often helpful to consider multiplication or division first.\n\nLet's try to use 98 as a base, because it's the largest number and might simplify easily with the others.\n\n98 / 2 = 49\n98 / 7 = 14 (not helpful)\n98 / 67 = a fraction (not helpful)\n\nNext, let's consider subtraction or addition with 29 and 67.\n\n98 - 29 = 69 (close, but not 60)\n98 - 67 = 31 (not close)\n\nNow, let's try to use 29 and 67 in a multiplication or addition with 98:\n\n98 + 29 = 127 (too large)\n98 + 67 = 165 (too large)\n\nSince direct addition and subtraction aren't helping, let's focus on multiplication and division.

Instead, let's try:\n\n98 / (67 - 29) = 98 / 38 = 2.5789 (not an integer)\n\nSo, let's try another approach:\n\n98 - (67 - 29) = 98 - 38 = 60\n\nThis works perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the equation is 98 - (67 - 29) = 60.\n</think>\n<answer> 98 - (67 - 29) </answer>"}]

Let's consider all possible operations and combinations.\n\n<think>\nI will start with the basic operations and try to see if 81 can be achieved directly or through a series of operations. \n\n1. Addition does not work as 63 + 45 + 35 = 143, which is too high, and 63 + 45 - 35 = 73, 63 + 35 - 45 = 53, and 45 + 35 - 63 = 17.\n\n2. Subtraction also does not directly give 81. For example, 63 - 45 - 35 = -17, 45 - 63 - 35 = -53.\n\n3. Multiplication cannot work as the product of any of these numbers will be too high or too low.\n\n4. Division can be considered, but direct division does not seem to work either. For example, 63 / 45 = 1.399, 45 / 63 = 0.714, 35 / 63 = 0.555, 35 / 45 = 0.777.\n\n5.

Now, I will consider a combination of all three numbers using division and addition:\n   - (63 + 45) / 35 = 108 / 35 = 3.114 (not an integer)\n   - (63 + 35) / 45 = 98 / 45 = 2.177 (not an integer)\n   - (45 + 35) / 63 = 80 / 63 = 1.270 (not an integer)\n\n7.

We need to find a combination of these numbers and basic arithmetic operations that will give us 98. Since 98 is close to 100, we might look for a way to get a number close to 98 and then adjust it.\n\nOne approach is to try multiplication or addition/subtraction to get close to 98. We can start by multiplying 42 and 33, which is 42 * 33 = 1416, but this is far from 98. So, we need to find a way to use 89 in such a way that we can get to 98.\n\nLet's try to subtract something from 1416 to get close to 98. If we subtract 1318 from 1416, we get 98. We can find 1318 by subtracting 89 from 1318, so we need to find a way to get 1318 using 42 and 33.\n\nIf we add 42 and 33, we get 75. We need to multiply this by 17.8466667 to get 1318, but since we are restricted to basic operations and need to use the numbers exactly once, we need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to use 89 and find a way to get 9 to add to 89 to get 98. If we subtract 33 from 89, we get 56. If we then subtract 42 from 56, we get -8, which is not helpful. Instead, we can add 42 to 56 to get 98. Let's check: 89 - 33 + 42 = 98.\n\nSo, the equation is: 89 - 33 + 42 = 98.</think>\n<answer>89 - 33 + 42</answer>"}]

Since 52 is less than 66, 75, and 29, it suggests we might need to subtract from a larger number.\n\nLet's start by trying to use 75:\n75 - 66 = 9, which is close to 52 but not quite there.\n\nNow, let's try using the number 9 in a more complex equation:\n75 - 66 = 9, and we need 43 more to reach 52. We can use 29 to get this:\n9 * 5 = 45, which is close to 43, and we can use the remaining number 29 to adjust:\n45 - 29 + 29 = 45, and then:\n45 - 3 = 42, and then:\n42 + 10 = 52.\n\nThis suggests we need to use 29 in a way that we can get close to 10. We can use 66 - 56 = 10, but we don't have 56. Instead, we can use 66 - 56 = 10 by rearranging:\n66 - 56 = 10, and then:\n9 * 5 = 45, and then:\n45 - 29 + 29 = 45, and then:\n45 - 3 = 42, and then:\n42 + 10 = 52.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is:\n9 * 5 = 45, and then:\n45 - 29 + 29 = 45, and then:\n45 - 7 = 38, and then:\n38 + 14 = 52.\n\nWe can use 75 - 61 = 14, and then:\n9 * 5 = 45, and then:\n45 - 29 + 29 = 45, and then:\n45 - 7 = 38, and then:\n38 + 14 = 52.\n\nBut a simpler and more direct approach is:\n(75 - 66) * 9 - 29 = 9 * 9 - 29 = 81 - 29 = 52.\n\nSo the equation is:\n(75 - 66) * 9 - 29 = 52.\n</think>\n<answer> (75 - 66) * 9 - 29 </answer>"}]

Since we can only use each number once, we need to be creative with our operations.\n\n- If we simply add 51 and 51, we get 102 which is more than 86.\n- If we subtract 51 from 86, we get 35, but we need to use the number 51 again.\n- If we divide 51 by 51, we get 1, but we still need to make use of 86.\n\nGiven these, the most straightforward way to use all numbers and reach 86 is to add 51 and then add 35, but since we can only use each number once, we need to find a way to incorporate the remaining 51 in a way that doesn't exceed the use of each number once.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the 51 as a divisor in a way that 86 can be achieved. We can do this by taking 51 and subtracting a fraction of itself to get to 35, but since we can't use division in a fractional form directly in this context, we need to think about multiplication or addition.\n\nConsidering the numbers again, the simplest way is to recognize that 86 can be directly achieved by using 51 in a subtraction operation from 137 (which is 51 + 86), but since we have two 51s, we can use one 51 and add 35, and 35 can be derived from 51 - 16, but 16 isn't available directly.\n\nThe most fitting and straightforward equation would be to use 51 + (86 - 51), but since we need to use each number only once, the equation would be 51 + (86 - 51) which simplifies to 51 + 35, but we need to use 51 exactly once, so we need to think about it in terms of the initial numbers given.\n\nSo, the correct way would be to use 51 + (86 - 51) which simplifies to 51 + 35, but since we need to use each number exactly once, we can rearrange it as 51 + (86 - 51) which is 51 + 35, but since we need to use 51 only once, we can think of it as 86 - 51 + 51, but since we can only use each number once, the most fitting and straightforward way is to directly use the numbers as given.\n\nSo, the equation is: 51 + (86 - 51)\n</think>\n<answer> 51 + (86 - 51) </answer>"}]

We need to use the numbers 31, 40, and 42 exactly once to reach this number using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nFirst, let's consider if any combination of these numbers can be added or subtracted to get 33. But, with 31 and 40, the closest we can get is 31 + 40 which is 71 or 40 - 31 which is 9. Neither of these are close to 33.\n\nNext, let's try multiplication or division. Multiplying any two of these numbers will result in a number that is much larger than 33, so we can eliminate that as an option. \n\nThis leaves us with division. We need to find a way to use division that results in 33. One way to approach this is to see if we can use one of the numbers as a divisor and the other two as the dividend and the quotient.\n\nLet's check if 42 can be used as the divisor. If we divide 42 by 1.33, we would get 32, which is close but not exact. So, we need to find a way to create 1.33 or a number close to it using the numbers 31 and 40.\n\nWe can use 40 - 31 = 9. Now, we need to see if we can use 9 in a way to get 1.33. We can use the division 42 / (40 - 31) = 42 / 9 = 4.6667, which is not 33.\n\nSince we have exhausted the possible operations, let's try another approach. We can try to subtract 31 from 42 and then add 40. This gives us 42 - 31 + 40 = 11 + 40 = 51, which is not 33.\n\nFinally, let's try to use 42 - 40 and then add 31. This gives us 42 - 40 + 31 = 2 + 31 = 33, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, the equation is (42 - 40) + 31 = 33.</think>\n<answer>(42 - 40) + 31</answer>"}]

After that, I will add or subtract the remaining numbers to reach the target of 89.\n\nSo, starting with 85:\n85 - 2 = 83\n\nNow, we need to add or subtract 61 and 67 to reach 89 from 83.\n83 - 61 = 22\n83 - 67 = 16\n\nNeither of these results is 89, so let's try adding:\n\n83 + 61 = 144\n83 + 67 = 150\n\nThese are also not 89. Let's try another combination.\n\nSince subtraction from 85 seems to be the key, let's try:\n85 - 67 = 18\n18 + 61 = 79\n79 + 2 = 81\n\nThis is still not 89. \n\nNow, let's try a different approach:\n85 - 61 = 24\n24 + 67 = 91\n91 - 2 = 89\n\nThis works! So, the equation is 85 - 61 + 67 - 2.\n</think>\n<answer> 85 - 61 + 67 - 2 </answer>"}]

Let's try the other permutations.\n\n27 * 94 / 22 - 66 = 105\n\nThis is still too high. Let's try a simpler combination.\n\n94 - 22 + 66 - 27 = 111\n\nThis is still too high. Let's try:\n\n66 - 27 + 94 - 22 = 111\n\nLet's try:\n\n94 - 66 + 27 - 22 = 23\n\nThis is too low.

We will try different combinations of the arithmetic operations to find a solution.\n\nLet's try to see if we can combine 65 and 45 first. If we add 65 and 45, we get 110. Now, we need to use 57 in a way that when combined with 110, we get 77. Clearly, 110 - 57 = 53, which is not 77. So, adding or subtracting 57 from 110 won't work.\n\nNext, let's try using multiplication. If we multiply 57 by 45, we get a very large number, which is not 77. If we multiply 57 by 65, we also get a large number, which is not 77. So, multiplication doesn't seem to be the operation to use here.\n\nNow, let's try division. If we divide 65 by 57, we get a number less than 1, which is not enough to get 77 when combined with 45. Similarly, dividing 45 by 57 or 65 doesn't work.\n\nThe only operation left is subtraction. If we subtract 57 from 65, we get 8, which is not 77. But if we use 45 in a way to combine with 8, we can see that 45 + 8 = 53, which is not 77. However, if we look at the possibility of using 45 and 65, we can see that if we subtract 65 from 45, we get -19, which is not 77. But if we reverse it and subtract 45 from 65, we get 20. Now, if we add 57 to 20, we get 77.\n\nSo, the equation is 65 - 45 + 57 = 77.\n</think>\n<answer> (65 - 45 + 57) </answer>"}]

Given the size of 85, it's likely that a multiplication or a large addition will be involved.\n\n1. The number 42 is the closest to 85, so we can start by using it as a base.\n2. We need to figure out how to get from 42 to 85 using the remaining numbers [4, 15, 17].\n\nIf we add 42 and 4, we get 46. We are still quite far from 85, so we need to use the remaining two numbers in a way that gets us closer.\n\nIf we add 17 to 46, we get 63, which is still not enough. If we try to use 15 in a multiplication, we can see that 15 * 4 = 60, which when added to 46 gives us 106, which is too much.\n\nThe only viable option seems to be to use 15 in a way that helps us get closer to 85 without overshooting. Multiplying 15 by 4 gives us 60, and adding 42 gives us 102, which is too much. However, if we subtract 17 from 102, we get 85.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 42 + (15 * 4) - 17 = 85.\n</think>\n<answer> 42 + (15 * 4) - 17 </answer>"}]

We have the numbers [5, 5, 59, 5] to use. We need to reach the target number 53. \n\n1. First, we notice 59 is the largest number and it's very close to 53. If we subtract 5 from 59, we get 54. This is close but not quite 53. \n\n2. We can then subtract another 1 from 54 to get 53. Since we have a 5 available, we can divide 5 by 5 to get 1. \n\n3.

Instead, consider \\(14 + 48 = 62\\). We need 21 more to reach 83.\n8. Now, use 49 - 26 = 23, but we only have 49.\n9. Re-evaluate: \\(48 + 14 = 62\\). We need 21 more. \n10. Use 49 - 26: \\(49 - 14 = 35\\), but we need 21. \n11.

We can't simply subtract or divide by the smaller numbers to get 16 because 82 - 70 = 12 and 82 - 4 = 78. 82 / 70 = 1.14, and 82 / 4 = 20.5. So, 82 is not a good starting point.\n\nNext, let's try 70. If we subtract 4 from 70, we get 66, which is still too high. 70 / 4 = 17.5, which is close but not 16. \n\nNow, let's use 4 as a factor. If we multiply 4 by 4, we get 16. But we only have one 4, so we need to use it in a way that involves the other two numbers. \n\nIf we divide 82 by 70, we get approximately 1.17. Multiplying this by 4 gives us about 4.68, which is far from 16.\n\nA different approach is needed. We can use the fact that 82 - 70 = 12. We need to get from 12 to 16. If we add 4 to 12, we get 16. \n\nSo, the equation we need is 82 - 70 + 4 = 16.\n\n<answer> 82 - 70 + 4 </answer>"}]

One way could be to subtract or divide some numbers to get a smaller number that can be added to others.\n\nLet's try to use 72 first since it's the largest number and might provide a good starting point. We can try subtracting or dividing it with the other numbers to see if we can get close to 32.\n\nIf we subtract 72 from 56, we get -16, which is far from 32. Let's try other combinations.\n\nIf we divide 72 by 7, we get approximately 10.2857, which is closer but still not 32.\n\nIf we divide 72 by 55, we get approximately 1.3091, which is even farther from 32.\n\nIf we subtract 72 from 55, we get -17, which is also not close.\n\nNow, let's try to use 55 and 56. If we subtract 56 from 55, we get -1, which is not helpful. If we add 55 and 56, we get 111, which is too large. We can try to manipulate 55 and 72 in some way to get closer to 32.\n\nOne approach could be to use 72 / 7, which is approximately 10.2857, add 55 to it, and see if we can get close to 32. \n\n55 + (72 / 7) = 55 + 10.2857 = 65.2857, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another approach by using 72 - 56 = 16, and then see if we can use the remaining numbers to get to 32.\n\nIf we take 16 and add 7, we get 23, which is still not 32. If we add 55 to 16, we get 71, which is closer but not 32.\n\nLet's try the following: 56 - 7 = 49, and then use 72 - 49 = 23. We can then add 7 to 23 to get 30, which is close but not 32.\n\nFinally, let's try: 56 - 7 = 49, and then use 72 - 49 = 23, and then add 55 - 23 = 32.\n\nSo, the equation is 55 - (72 - (56 - 7)) = 32.</think>\n<answer>55 - (72 - (56 - 7))</answer>"}]

An alternative is to subtract 25 from 8, which is -17, and then add 47 to get 30, which is still too low.\n9. Another approach is to use division. If we divide 47 by 8, we get approximately 5.875, and adding 25 gives us 30.875, which is still too low.\n10.

Let's try to form a small number from the larger ones and then use division to get close to 25.\n\nIf we subtract 29 from 91, we get 62. Then, if we divide 62 by 2.48 (which we can get by subtracting 24 from 86 and then dividing by 100), we would get approximately 25.

If we add 29 and 24, we get 53. Now, we need to reduce this by a factor that will give us 25. The number 86 could help us here.

If we use subtraction, we can start with a larger number and subtract a smaller one to get closer to 41.\n2. We can also consider multiplication or division to see if they help in achieving the target.\n\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n- 63 - 50 = 13 (Still far from 41)\n- 63 - 7 = 56 (Getting closer, but still not 41)\n- 50 - 63 = -13 (Too far in the wrong direction)\n- 50 - 7 = 43 (Close, but not 41)\n\nNow, let's try using multiplication or division:\n\n- 63 / 7 = 9 (This is too small to get us to 41)\n- 50 * 7 = 350 (This is too large)\n- 63 * 7 = 441 (This is also too large)\n\nGiven these initial attempts, it seems addition might help.

First, we could try subtracting 22 from 45, which gives us 23.\n2. Then, we could divide 55 by the result from above (23), but this would give a result greater than 32.\n3. Instead, we could try subtracting 32 from one of our initial numbers and then adjust with the others.\n4. If we subtract 32 from 45, we get 13. Now, we need to use 22 and 55 to get to 13.\n\nWe can use the fact that 55 - 22 = 33, and then subtract 20 to get to 13. But since we can only use each number once, we can instead try:\n- Using 45 - 32 = 13, and then we need to incorporate 22 and 55.\n- We can use 22 - 13 = 9, and then 55 - 9 = 46, but this is not useful.\n- Instead, we can use 55 - 22 = 33, and then 33 - 11 = 22, but we need 11, not 22.\n\nThe correct approach seems to be:\n- 45 - 22 = 23\n- 55 - 23 = 32\n\nSo, the equation that uses all numbers once and equals 32 is 55 - (45 - 22).\n</think>\n<answer> 55 - (45 - 22) </answer>"}]

We can try to divide 83 by a smaller number to get a quotient that, when added to or subtracted from another number, can result in 68.\n\nLet's try dividing 83 by 36:\n- 83 / 36 \u2248 2.3056, which is not an integer and doesn't seem to lead to an integer solution when combined with other numbers.\n\nNext, let's try dividing 83 by 17:\n- 83 / 17 \u2248 4.8824, which is also not an integer.\n\nWe can try subtracting 17 from 38 and then adding the result to 36:\n- 38 - 17 = 21\n- 36 + 21 = 57, which is close but not 68.\n\nLet's try adding 36 and 38 and then subtracting the result from 83:\n- 36 + 38 = 74\n- 83 - 74 = 9, which is not 68.\n\nFinally, let's try subtracting 17 from 38 and then adding the result to 36:\n- 38 - 17 = 21\n- 36 + 21 = 57, which is close but not 68.\n\nAfter trying these combinations, we realize we need to find a different approach. Let's try subtracting 17 from 38 and then adding 36:\n- 38 - 17 = 21\n- 21 + 36 = 57, which is close but not 68.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- 38 + 17 = 55\n- 55 + 36 - 83 = -12, which is not 68.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- 38 + 36 = 74\n- 74 - 17 = 57, which is close but not 68.\n\nAfter several attempts, we find that:\n- 83 - 17 - 36 + 38 = 68.\n\nThus, the correct equation is:\n<answer> 83 - 17 - 36 + 38 </answer>."}]

We need to experiment with different combinations and operations to find a solution.\n3. Let's start with 66, as it's the largest number and might help us get close to 68 quickly.\n4.

Let's consider the operations and how we can use each number only once.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use subtraction and division. We can start by subtracting 52 from 88, which gives us 36. Then, we need to divide this result by 55 and subtract from 19, but that won't work directly. We need to find a way to use 55 in the equation in a way that makes sense.\n\nAnother approach is to use division and subtraction. If we divide 55 by 88, we get a fraction which is less than 1. We can then subtract this fraction from 52 to get a result close to 19. However, this approach is complex and might not give us an exact 19.\n\nA simpler and more effective approach is to use 55 as a divisor. We can subtract 88 from 52, then divide the result by 55.\n\nLet's try: (52 - 88) / 55\nThis gives us: -36 / 55\n\nThis doesn't give us 19. Let's try another combination.\n\nWe can use 55 as a multiplier and 88 as a divisor. If we do 55 / 88, we get a fraction. We can then use 52 to adjust this fraction to be close to 19.\n\nLet's try: 55 / (88 - 52)\nThis gives us: 55 / 36\n\nThis still doesn't give us 19. Let's try one more combination.\n\nWe can use subtraction and division directly. If we subtract 52 from 55, we get 3. Then, we can use 88 in a way that when we subtract it from 3, we get 19. However, this approach doesn't work either.\n\nThe correct approach is to use division and subtraction directly. If we take 52 and subtract 88, we get -36. Then, we can divide -36 by -55 to get a positive number close to 19.\n\nLet's try: (52 - 88) / (-55)\nThis gives us: -36 / -55 = 36 / 55\n\nThis still doesn't give us 19. Let's try another combination.\n\nThe correct approach is to use subtraction and division directly. If we take 55 and subtract 88, we get -33. Then, we can divide -33 by -52 to get a positive number close to 19.\n\nLet's try: (88 - 55) / 52\nThis gives us: 33 / 52\n\nThis still doesn't give us 19.

Let's consider the possible operations:\n\n1. Addition: This would require the sum of the numbers to be 32, which is not possible with these numbers.\n2. Subtraction: This could involve subtracting a smaller number from a larger one to get 32, but again, it's not straightforward.\n3. Multiplication: This operation might not be useful for getting 32 directly.\n4. Division: This operation is more flexible and can be used to manipulate the numbers.\n\nLet's try to form an equation:\n- 83 - 81 = 2, but we still need to use 32.\n- 81 - 83 = -2, which is not useful.\n- 83 - 32 = 51, which is not 32.\n- 81 - 32 = 49, which is not 32.\n- 83 - 2 = 81, which is not 32.\n- 81 - 2 = 79, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 83 = -51, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 81 = -49, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 2 = 30, which is not 32.\n- 2 - 32 = -30, which is not 32.\n- 2 - 81 = -79, which is not 32.\n- 2 - 83 = -81, which is not 32.\n\nNow, let's consider multiplication and division:\n- 83 * 2 = 166, which is not 32.\n- 81 * 2 = 162, which is not 32.\n- 32 * 2 = 64, which is not 32.\n- 83 / 2 = 41.5, which is not 32.\n- 81 / 2 = 40.5, which is not 32.\n- 32 / 2 = 16, which is not 32.\n\nNow, let's try using addition and subtraction in combination:\n- 81 - 83 + 32 = -2 + 32 = 30, which is not 32.\n- 83 - 81 + 32 = 2 + 32 = 34, which is not 32.\n- 83 - 32 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53, which is not 32.\n- 81 - 32 + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51, which is not 32.\n- 81 - 2 + 32 = 79 + 32 = 111, which is not 32.\n- 83 - 2 + 32 = 81 + 32 = 113, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 81 + 2 = -49 + 2 = -47, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 83 + 2 = -51 + 2 = -49, which is not 32.\n- 32 - 2 + 81 = 30 + 81 = 111, which is not 32.\n- 83 - 2 - 81 = 81 - 83 = -2, which is not 32.\n\nFinally, let's consider division and subtraction:\n- 81 / 2 - 32 = 40.5 - 32 = 8.5, which is not 32.\n- 83 / 2 - 32 = 41.5 - 32 = 9.5, which is not 32.\n- 32 / 2 - 81 = 16 - 81 = -65, which is not 32.\n- 32 / 2 - 83 = 16 - 83 = -67, which is not 32.\n- 83 / 2 - 81 = 41.5 - 81 = -39.5, which is not 32.\n- 81 / 2 - 83 = 40.5 - 83 = -42.5, which is not 32.\n\nAfter considering all the combinations, I realize that the simplest and most direct way is to use the number 32 itself and the remaining numbers to form an equation that equals 32. The equation is:\n32 - 0 = 32, but since we can only use 83, 81, 2, and 32, we can use the remaining numbers to form 0, which is 83 - 81 - 2.

First, we need to consider the target number, which is 13.\n2. We have four numbers: 65, 91, 6, and 7.\n3. We need to use each number only once and we can use +, -, *, / operations.\n4. A good starting point would be to look for numbers that can be combined to get close to 13.\n\nConsidering 65 and 91, they are much larger than 13, so we need to find a way to reduce these numbers or use the other numbers to get to 13.\n\n5. If we subtract 65 from 91, we get 26 (91 - 65 = 26).\n6. Now, we need to use 6 and 7 to reach 13 from 26.\n7. If we divide 26 by 6, we get 4.33 (26 / 6 = 4.33).\n8. We can then subtract 7 from 4.33, but this won't give us an integer.\n9. Instead, let's try a different approach:\n   - If we use 65 - 7, we get 58 (65 - 7 = 58).\n   - 58 - 6 = 52.\n   - 52 - 91 = -39, which is not helpful.\n10.

We need to form an equation using these numbers such that the result is 55. We should try different combinations of the arithmetic operations.\n\nOne effective way to approach this is to look at the differences between the numbers. For instance, 67 - 56 = 11. If we can use 5 and 63 with 11, we might be able to form 55.\n\nAnother approach could be to use 67 and 56 as a base and then adjust with 5 and 63.\n\nLet's try: (67 - 56) + 5 + 63 = 11 + 5 + 63 = 79. This is not 55, so let's try another combination.\n\nWe can also try: 63 - (67 - 56) = 63 - 11 = 52, and then adding 5: 52 + 5 = 57.

Let's consider the operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nFirst, let's try to get a close number to 25 using these numbers. \n\nIf we subtract 86 from 99, we get 13. This is not close to 25. \n\nIf we add 8 to 4, we get 12. This is still not close to 25. \n\nNow, let's try to use 86 in a different way. If we divide 86 by 4, we get 21.5. Adding 8 to 21.5 gives us 29.5, which is close but not 25.\n\nConsidering the operations and the closeness, we can use 86 - (99 - 4) = 86 - 95 = -9, then add 8 to get -1, and finally add 26 (which we can get by 4 + 22, but 22 is not among the numbers), so we need to rethink.\n\nInstead, we can try: (99 - 86) - (4 - 8) = 13 - (-4) = 13 + 4 = 17. This is not 25, so let's try another combination.\n\nIf we try: (99 - 86) + (8 + 4) = 13 + 12 = 25. This works. \n\nSo, the equation is (99 - 86) + (8 + 4) = 25. </think>\n<answer> (99 - 86) + (8 + 4) </answer>"}]

So, the equation could be 87 - 58 - 5 = 24, and then 58 + 24 = 82, but we need to adjust for the 31.\n11. A simpler and more direct approach: 87 - 22 = 65, and 22 can be 58 - 36, but 36 isn't in our list. Instead, we can use 58 - 5 - 31 = 22.\n12. Therefore, the equation is 87 - (58 - 5 - 31) = 65.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 87 - (58 - 5 - 31) </answer>"}]

Let's try:\n\n89 - 74 = 15\n15 - 33 = -18 (too low)\n15 - 67 = -52 (too low)\n\nAnother approach could be to use division. 89 / 74 is too small, so let's try:\n\n(89 - 67) / 33 = 22 / 33 (too large)\n\nNow, let's try:\n\n(89 - 74) / (67 - 33) = 15 / 34 (too small)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n(89 - 74) + (67 - 33) = 15 + 34 = 49 (too large)\n\nAfter several attempts, we find:\n\n(89 - 74) - (67 - 33) = 15 - 34 = -19 (too low)\n\nWe need to find a combination that exactly equals 19. Let's try:\n\n(67 - 33) + (74 - 89) = 34 - 15 = 19\n\nThis combination works.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (67 - 33) + (74 - 89) </answer>"}]

We should consider various combinations of operations.\n\n1. First, let's try to subtract 17 from 85, which gives us 68. Then we need to subtract 28 to get 40 (68 - 28 = 40). We can use 8 * 3.5, but 3.5 is not an integer, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n2. Next, let's try to divide 85 by 17, which gives us approximately 5. Then, we need to add 35 to get 40 (5 + 35 = 40). We can use 8 * 4.375, but again, this isn't an integer, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n3. Let's try multiplication and subtraction. We can multiply 8 and 17 to get 136, then subtract 96 to get 40 (136 - 96 = 40). We can use 85 - 49, but 49 is not a product of 17 and 8.\n\n4. Finally, let's try to use addition and subtraction. We can add 17 and 8 to get 25, then subtract this from 85 (85 - 25 = 60), but we need to adjust to get 40. We can use 85 - (17 + 8) - 17, but this doesn't work either as it results in 40 - 17 = 23.\n\n5. The last approach is to use division and subtraction. We can divide 85 by 8 to get approximately 10.625, then subtract 6.625 to get 40 (10.625 - 6.625 = 4). We can use 17 * 2.5 - 8, but 2.5 is not an integer.\n\nAfter considering these approaches, the correct solution is to use multiplication and subtraction. We can multiply 8 and 5 to get 40, and we can get 5 by dividing 85 by 17.\n\nSo, the equation is 8 * (85 / 17) = 40.\n</think>\n<answer> 8 * (85 / 17) </answer>"}]

Let's think through this step by step:\n\n- We can subtract 28 from 56, which gives us 28.\n- Now we have 28, 28, and 6 left.\n- If we subtract 6 from one of the 28s, we get 22.\n- Finally, if we subtract 22 from the other 28, we get 6.\n\nSo, the sequence of operations is:  \n(56 - 28) - (28 - 6) = 28 - 22 = 6\n\nBut this doesn't quite give us 20. We need to rethink the approach.\n\n- Another way to approach this is to consider multiplication or division. Since 28 is a factor of 56, we can use it to our advantage.\n- We can divide 56 by 28 to get 2.\n- Then we can add 2 to 18 (which is 28 - 10, and 10 is 6 + 4, but we only have 6 and 28, so let's try 28 - 16, where 16 is 28 - 12, and 12 is 6 * 2).\n\nSo, the correct sequence is:\n56 / 28 + (28 - 6 * 2)\n\nLet's break this down:\n- 56 / 28 = 2\n- 28 - 6 * 2 = 28 - 12 = 16\n- 2 + 16 = 18\n\nThis still isn't 20. Let's try another combination:\n\n- We can use 6 and 28 to get closer to 20.\n- 28 - 6 = 22\n- Now we need to get from 22 to 20, which is a difference of 2.\n\nSo, the correct equation is:\n28 - (6 + (56 / 28))\n\nLet's break this down:\n- 56 / 28 = 2\n- 6 + 2 = 8\n- 28 - 8 = 20\n\nTherefore, the final equation is:\n<answer> 28 - (6 + (56 / 28)) </answer>"}]

We can try different operations and see if they work.\n\nFirst, let's try 92 - 37 = 55, and then we need to get to 58 by using 1 and 71. We can add 3 to 55 to get 58, but we don't have a 3.

We can use 37 - 1 = 36, and then add 22 to 36 to get 58. But we don't have a 22.\n\nLet's try using division. If we use 92 / 2 = 46, we need 12 more to get to 58.

Since 85 and 78 are significantly larger than 17, we need to use them in a way that they don't exceed 17.\n2. We can start by subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones.

If we subtract 5 from 43, we get 38, which is also far from 80. Multiplying 43 by 5 gives 215, which is too large. \n\nNow, let's consider the number 27. If we use 27 in an addition or subtraction, it might bring us closer to 80 when combined with 43 and 5 in some way.\n\nIf we add 27 to 80, we get 107, which is too large. If we subtract 27 from 80, we get 53, which is also not the result we want. \n\nNow, let's try multiplication and division.\n\nIf we multiply 43 by 5, we get 215, which is too large. \n\nIf we divide 43 by 5, we get 8.6, which is not an integer and won't help us reach 80.\n\nIf we multiply 27 by 5, we get 135, which is also too large.\n\nIf we divide 27 by 5, we get 5.4, which is not an integer.\n\nWe need to find a combination that works. Let's try:\n43 - 27 = 16\n16 * 5 = 80\n\nSo, the equation that uses all the numbers (27, 43, and 5) exactly once and equals 80 is:\n\n<answer> (43 - 27) * 5 </answer>"}]

Multiplying 15 and 31 gives 465, which is too large. Dividing 79 by 1.7265 (approximation of 79/45) doesn't work with the given numbers.\n\nThen, I consider using 78. Subtracting 78 from 45 gives -33, which is too far off. However, adding 78 to 45 gives 123, which is also too large. \n\nI try to use 78 in a division or multiplication with other numbers. 78 divided by 1.7265 (approximation of 78/45) is close to 15, but not exact.\n\nAfter trying various combinations and seeing that direct operations don't work, I consider a combination of operations. \n\n78 - 79 = -1\n-1 + 31 = 30\n30 + 15 = 45\n\nThis combination works. \n\nSo, the equation is 78 - 79 + 31 + 15.\n</think>\n<answer> (78 - 79 + 31 + 15) </answer>"}]

Let's try another simple way.\n\nAnother simple way is 81 - 31 = 50, and we can get 31 as 86 - 55, and 55 = 18 + 37. So, 81 - (86 - (18 + 37)) = 50. But this is still complex.\n\nLet's try: 81 - 31 = 50, and 31 = 86 - 55, and 55 = 18 + 37. So, 81 - (86 - (18 + 37)) = 50. But this is still complex.\n\nFinally, a simpler approach is to use 81 - 31 = 50, and 31 = 86 - 55, and 55 = 18 + 37. So, 81 - (86 - (18 + 37)) = 50. But this is still complex.\n\nThe simplest way is: 81 - 31 = 50, and 31 = 86 - 55, and 55 = 18 + 37. So, 81 - (86 - (18 + 37)) = 50. But this is still complex.\n\nFinally, a simpler and correct approach is: 81 - (86 - 37 - 18) = 50.\n</think>\n<answer> 81 - (86 - 37 - 18) </answer>"}]

We have three numbers: 53, 19, and 50. We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them using basic arithmetic operations to get the result 57.\n\n1. First, let's consider the possibility of using addition and subtraction. We can't simply add or subtract the numbers directly as 53 + 19 + 50 = 122, which is too high, and 53 + 19 - 50 = 22, which is too low. Similarly, 53 - 19 - 50 = -16, and 53 - 19 + 50 = 84, which is also too high.\n\n2. Next, let's consider multiplication and division, and how we can use these to get closer to 57. We can start by trying to use multiplication to get a product close to 57 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n3. Let's try to use 53 as a base and then find a combination with the other two numbers. If we multiply 53 by 1, that doesn't help. If we use 53 and 19, we get 53 * 19 = 1007, which is far too high. If we use 53 and 50, we get 53 * 50 = 2650, which is also far too high.\n\n4. We need to think of a way to use the division operation. If we divide 53 by 19, we get approximately 2.789, which is not very helpful. However, if we consider the possibility of using division in a way to adjust our result, we might find a solution.\n\n5. Let's try to use subtraction in a way that can help us reach 57. We can start by subtracting 19 from 53, which gives us 34. Then, if we subtract 50 from 34, we get -16, which is not helpful. However, if we add 50 to 34, we get 84, which is close but not quite 57.\n\n6. We need to find a way to use the numbers to get exactly 57. Let's try using the division operation in a different way. If we divide 53 by 50, we get 1.06, which is not very helpful. However, if we use the division in a way that can help us adjust our result, we might find a solution.\n\n7. After some experimentation, we can see that if we take 50 and subtract 19 from it, we get 31. Then, if we add 53 to 31, we get 84, which is close but not quite 57. However, if we instead take 53 and subtract 31 from it, we get 22. Then, if we add 35 to 22, we get 57. But we can't use 35, so we need to find a way to get 35 using the numbers we have.\n\n8. After further consideration, we can see that if we use the division operation in a different way, we can find a solution. If we divide 53 by 19, we get approximately 2.789. If we multiply this by 50, we get approximately 139.8, which is far too high. However, if we use the division operation in a way that can help us adjust our result, we might find a solution.\n\n9. After some more experimentation, we can see that if we take 53 and subtract 19 from it, we get 34. Then, if we add 23 to 34, we get 57. But we can't use 23, so we need to find a way to get 23 using the numbers we have.\n\n10. After further consideration, we can see that if we use the division operation in a different way, we can find a solution. If we take 53 and subtract 50 from it, we get 3. Then, if we multiply 3 by 19, we get 57.\n\n<answer> (53 - 50) * 19 </answer>"}]

We should try to create a smaller number that we can then adjust to 42 using the remaining numbers.\n\nOne approach is to use 91 and 47 in a way that reduces them to a value we can use with the other numbers. One way to do this is by using subtraction: 91 - 47 = 44.\n\nNow, we need to use the numbers 22 and 11 to adjust 44 to 42. We can do this by subtracting 2 from 44. Since 22 - 11 = 11, we can use this to our advantage.\n\nSo, we need to find a way to incorporate 11 into our equation and also subtract 2 from 44.

Let's start by subtracting 94 from 90, which gives us 6. Then we can use 20 and 15 in a way to get to 80. If we divide 15 by 20, we get 0.75. If we add 6 and 0.75, we get 6.75, which is far from 80. \n\nAnother approach could be to use multiplication. If we multiply 20 and 15, we get 300, which is too high. If we divide 90 by 15, we get 6. If we subtract 6 from 94, we get 88. If we subtract 20 from 88, we get 68, which is close but not 80.\n\nIf we use addition and subtraction, we can try:\n94 - 15 = 79\n79 + 1 = 80\n\nWe can get 1 by dividing 20 by 20, but we need to use 90 as well.

Let's try a simpler approach:\n94 - 14 = 80\n14 can be obtained by 90 - 76, but 76 is not one of our numbers. \n\nFinally, a simpler and direct approach:\n94 - 14 = 80\n14 can be obtained by 20 - 6\n6 can be obtained by 90 / 15\n\nSo the equation would be:\n94 - (20 - (90 / 15)) = 80\n\n</think>\n<answer> 94 - (20 - (90 / 15)) </answer>"}]

Could you please help me create an equation using the numbers [88, 58, 8, 77] that equals 39? Use basic arithmetic operations and ensure each number is used only once. <think> To solve this, I need to find a combination of the numbers that, when combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, results in 39. Let's start by trying to use subtraction or addition to get close to 39. \n\nIf we subtract 77 from 88, we get 11, which is too small. If we subtract 58, we get 30, which is closer but still a bit short. If we subtract 8, we get 80, which is too large. So, we might need to use multiplication or division.\n\nNow, let's try to use multiplication or division with the numbers we have. If we divide 88 by 8, we get 11, which is not helpful. If we divide 58 by 8, we get 7.25, which is also not helpful. So, let's try to use 58 and 8 in a different way.\n\nIf we subtract 8 from 58, we get 50. Now, we need to use 88 and 77 in a way that brings us to 39. If we subtract 77 from 88, we get 11. Now, we can use 50 and 11 in a way that results in 39. \n\nIf we subtract 11 from 50, we get 39.

We can get 3.5 by using 14 and 52, but in a way that gives us 3.5.\n\nNow, let's try:\n(77 - 52) / (56 / 14) = 25 / 4 = 6.25, which is not 21.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n(77 - 56) / (52 / 14) = 21 / 4 = 5.25, which is not 21.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n(77 - 52) - (56 / 14) = 25 - 4 = 21\n\nThis equation works.\n</think>\n\n<answer>(77 - 52) - (56 / 14)</answer>"}]
