Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. First, let's consider the largest numbers 97 and 71. Subtracting them from each other would give a large negative number.\n2. Next, let's try subtracting 18 from 97 or 71, but that would not get us close to 36.\n3. Now, let's try dividing 97 or 71 by 18, but that would result in a fraction.\n4. Let's try combining 18 and 8. If we add 18 and 8, we get 26. Now we need 10 more to reach 36.\n\nFrom this, we can see that we should add 10 to 26. We can get 10 by subtracting 8 from 18. \n\nSo, the equation would be: 18 + 8 - (97 - 71).\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n18 + 8 = 26\n97 - 71 = 26\n26 - 26 = 0\n\nThis is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate:\n\nIf we subtract 8 from 18, we get 10. Now we need to use 71 and 97 in a way that gives us 26. \n\nTrying 71 - 35 would give us 36, but we don't have 35. However, if we use 97 - 61, we get 36. We can get 61 by combining 53 and 8, but we don't have 53. \n\nRevisiting the numbers, the correct combination is:\n18 - 8 = 10\n71 - 97 = -26\n-26 + 36 = 10\n\nThis is still incorrect. Let's try another approach:\n\nIf we use 18 - 8 = 10, we need 26 more to reach 36. We can get 26 by using 71 - 97, but that gives -26. \n\nAnother attempt:\n(97 - 71) = 26\n26 + 10 = 36\n\n10 is from 18 - 8.\n\nSo, the correct equation is: (97 - 71) + (18 - 8).\n\n</think>\n<answer> (97 - 71) + (18 - 8) </answer>"}]

One way to do this is by adding or subtracting 8 from a number that, when multiplied by 82, still gives 82. \n\nIf we divide 82 by 8, we get 10.25, which isn't an integer and thus not useful.

Multiplying or dividing might work, but we need to consider the order of operations.\n3. A combination of addition and multiplication might be effective.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n- (42 * 1) + 40 = 42 + 40 = 82 (This is close but not 81)\n- (42 * 1) - 40 = 42 - 40 = 2 (This is far from 81)\n- (42 - 1) * 40 = 41 * 40 = 1640 (This is too large)\n- (42 - 40) * 1 = 2 * 1 = 2 (This is far from 81)\n- (40 * 1) + 42 = 40 + 42 = 82 (This is close but not 81)\n- (40 - 1) * 42 = 39 * 42 = 1638 (This is too large)\n\nAfter trying these, we can see that a combination of addition and multiplication might work.

Let's try:\n\n(42 - 1) * (40 / 5) - 40 = 41 * 8 - 40 = 328 - 40 = 288 (This is too large)\n\nWe need to adjust one more time. Let's try:\n\n(42 * 2) + 17 = 84 + 17 = 101 (This is too large)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n(42 + 40) - 1 = 82 - 1 = 81 (This works)\n\nSo, the equation that equals 81 using the numbers 42, 1, and 40 is (42 + 40) - 1.\n</think>\n<answer> (42 + 40) - 1 </answer>"}]

We need to use the numbers 97, 82, and 42 to create an equation that equals 27.\n2. We should try different combinations of the numbers and arithmetic operations to see what works.\n\nFirst, let's consider if we can use division or subtraction directly to get close to 27. If we subtract 42 from 82, we get 40, which is close but not quite 27. If we subtract 42 from 97, we get 55, which is even farther. So, direct subtraction doesn't seem to work well.\n\nNext, let's try multiplication or addition. If we add 42 and 82, we get 124, which is far from 27. If we multiply 42 and 82, we get 3444, which is even farther. So, multiplication and addition alone don't seem to be the way to go.\n\nNow, let's try a combination. If we subtract 42 from 82, we get 40. Then, if we subtract 97 from 40, we get -57. This is not helpful. So, we need to think about how we can use 97 in a way that gets us closer to 27.\n\nAnother idea could be to divide 97 by a number to get a smaller result. If we divide 97 by 42, we get approximately 2.31, which is closer but still not 27.\n\nLet's think about the number 82. If we subtract 55 from 82, we get 27. Now, the question is, how can we use 97 and 42 to get 55? If we subtract 42 from 97, we get 55. So, we can combine these steps.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 82 - (97 - 42) = 27\n</think>\n\n<answer> 82 - (97 - 42) </answer>"}]

We need to use the numbers 35, 84, and 35 to create an equation that equals 84.\n2. We can use the basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /.\n3. Each number can only be used once, so we need to find a way to use 35 and 84 in a way that results in 84.\n4. Since 84 is already in the list and we need it to be the result, we should try to use the other two numbers (35 and 35) in such a way that when combined, they result in 84.\n5. One way to achieve this is to subtract 35 from 84, which gives us 49. However, we have another 35 to use.\n6. We can then add 35 to 49, but since we only have one 35 left, we need to find a way to use it in such a way that the equation still equals 84.\n7. A viable solution is to use multiplication: (35 * 2) - 35 = 70 - 35 = 35. However, this doesn't directly give us 84.\n8. Instead, we can use (35 * 2) = 70, and then add 14 to it. But again, we don't have 14 as a separate number.\n9. The simplest and most direct way is to recognize that we can use 35 and 35 in a straightforward manner to achieve our goal. We can use 35 * 2 = 70 and then add 14, but since we don't have 14, we should try a direct subtraction or addition.\n10. The easiest and most logical way is to use 84 = 35 + 35 + 14. However, since we can't use 14, we need to find a way to use the numbers as given.\n11. The simplest solution that adheres to the rules is to use 84 as it is and then add (35 - 35) to it, which doesn't change the value but satisfies the requirement of using all numbers.\n12. Therefore, the equation is 84 + (35 - 35) = 84.\n\n<answer> 84 + (35 - 35) </answer>"}]

The simplest way is to use subtraction, where we can subtract 98 from 82 and then add the result to 98.\n\nSo, the equation can be 98 - (82 - 98).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- (82 - 98) = -16\n- 98 - (-16) = 98 + 16 = 114, which is not correct.\n- Instead, we should directly use 98 and 82 in a simpler form.\n\nThe correct approach is to use 98 and 82 in a way that directly leads to 98. The simplest way is to use 98 and subtract 0, which can be derived from 82 - 82.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: 98 - (82 - 82).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- (82 - 82) = 0\n- 98 - 0 = 98\n\nThus, the equation that equals 98 using the numbers [82, 82, 98] is 98 - (82 - 82).\n</think>\n<answer> 98 - (82 - 82) </answer>"}]

We should try to use the numbers in a way that their arithmetic combination results in 93. Let's consider the operations and how we can manipulate the numbers:\n\n1. **Using 94 directly**: We can subtract a certain value from 94 to get 93. This means we need to find a way to get a 1 (since 94 - 1 = 93).\n2. **Using 25 and 26**: We can think of ways to combine 25 and 26 to get a value that when subtracted from 94, results in 93.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- 94 - (26 - 25) = 94 - 1 = 93.\n\nSo, by using the numbers as 94 - (26 - 25), we can achieve the desired result.\n\n<answer> 94 - (26 - 25) </answer>"}]

Let's go back to the basic arithmetic and consider:\n- If I try 98 - 66 = 32, and then 32 - 4 = 28, it's not 36.\n- If I try 66 - 4 = 62, and then 62 - 98 = -36, it's not 36.\n- If I try 98 - 4 = 94, and then 94 - 66 = 28, it's not 36.\n\nFinally, I should consider the possibility of division with 4 as a divisor:\n- If I try 98 - 66 = 32, and then 32 / 4 = 8, it's not 36.\n- If I try 66 - 4 = 62, and then 62 / 98, it's not an integer.\n- If I try 98 - 4 = 94, and then 94 / 66, it's not an integer.\n\nAfter all these trials, I realize I'm missing a simpler approach.

Now, consider using 13 and 12 in conjunction with 87, primarily through addition or subtraction:\n   - 87 - (13 * 12) = 87 - 156 = -69 (too low)\n   - 87 - (12 * 13) = 87 - 156 = -69 (too low)\n   - 87 + (13 * 12) = 87 + 156 = 243 (too high)\n   - 87 + (12 * 13) = 87 + 156 = 243 (too high)\n   - 13 * (87 - 12) = 13 * 75 = 975 (too high)\n   - 12 * (87 - 13) = 12 * 74 = 888 (too high)\n5. The correct approach seems to be using subtraction and addition:\n   - 87 - 13 = 74\n   - 74 - 12 = 62\n\nSo, the equation using the numbers 13, 87, and 12 that equals 62 is 87 - 13 - 12.\n</think>\n<answer> 87 - 13 - 12 </answer>"}]

Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to target the result of 12, so we're looking for an equation that equals 12.\n2. We have four numbers: 12, 10, 74, and 80.\n3. The number 12 is already close to our target, which makes it a good starting point.\n4. We can use the other numbers to manipulate the equation to get exactly 12.\n5. If we subtract 10 from 22, we get 12 (22 - 10 = 12).\n6. We can create 22 by adding 12 and 10.\n7. We can't use 12 and 10 directly in this way, so we need to find another combination.\n8. If we divide 74 by 80, we get a fraction (74/80), which is less than 1.\n9. Multiplying this fraction by 12 will still be less than 12, so this approach won't work.\n10. Instead, we can use 74 - 80, which gives us -6.\n11. If we multiply this negative number by -2, we get 12.\n12.

Since 69 is much larger than 42, subtracting or dividing it might be necessary.\n3. The number 29 is also larger than 42, so similar operations might be needed.\n4.

Instead, we could try subtracting 6 from 78 to get 72, and then add this to 87.\n5. 87 + 72 = 159, which is too high.\n6. We need to find a way to use 6 in a way that doesn't make the sum too large.\n7. If we divide 87 by 6, we get approximately 14.5. This is a bit too low, but we can use the floor of this value.\n8. If we use the floor of 87 / 6, which is 14, and then add 78, we get 92. This is still not 100.\n9. We need to find another way to use 6.\n10. If we multiply 87 by 6, we get 522, which is too large.\n11. If we divide 78 by 6, we get 13. This is a bit too low, but we can use the floor of this value.\n12. If we use the floor of 78 / 6, which is 13, and then add 87, we get 100.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (78 / 6) + 87 </answer>"}]

If we divide 57 by 83, we get approximately 0.6867, which is not close to 40. We need to find a way to get closer to 40.\n\nConsidering the numbers again, we can try to use 66 as a key number. If we subtract 66 from 83, we get 17. This is not close to 40, but we can use 57 in a way that gets us closer.\n\nIf we subtract 57 from 17, we get -40, which is close but not quite there. We need to manipulate the numbers to get exactly 40.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we see that if we multiply 57 by 1.4516 (approximately 66/57), we get close to 82.55. Subtracting 83 - 82.55 gives us approximately 0.45, which is not close to 40.\n\nAfter several trials, we find that:\n66 - (83 - 57) = 66 - 26 = 40.\n</think>\n<answer> 66 - (83 - 57) </answer>"}]

Let's consider the operations: if we can somehow reduce 80 or 58 and then add 11, it might work.\n3. One approach is to subtract 11 from 58, which gives us 47, and then try to get to 33 by using 80.\n4.

We can use 6 and 5 for this.\n- 52 + 34 = 86\n- 86 - 6 = 80\n- 80 + 5 = 85\n\nThus, the correct equation is 52 + 34 - 6 + 5.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 52 + 34 - 6 + 5 </answer>"}]

If we take 69 and multiply it by something close to 1.275 (since 69 * 1.275 \u2248 88), we might be able to get 88. However, since we can only use integer operations, we might need to approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the other numbers and see if they can help us get to 88 when combined with 69. Let's try adding or subtracting the other numbers to 69 to see if we can get close to 88.\n\nIf we add 41 and 47, we get 88. However, we need to use 13 as well, and we can't just add or subtract it from 88 because we need to use all numbers. So, let's consider using 13 in a way that doesn't change the sum of 88.\n\nOne way to do this is to subtract 13 from one of the numbers that we are using to get 88. If we take 41 and subtract 13 from it, we get 28. Then, if we add this to 69 and 47, we get:\n\n69 + 47 + (41 - 13) = 69 + 47 + 28 = 144\n\nThis is too high, so we need to adjust our approach. Instead, let's try a different combination.\n\nIf we take 69 and add 41, we get 110. Then, if we subtract 47, we get 63. Finally, if we add 13, we get:\n\n69 + 41 - 47 + 13 = 86\n\nThis is close but not 88. Let's try another combination.\n\nIf we take 69 and add 47, we get 116. Then, if we subtract 41, we get 75. Finally, if we add 13, we get:\n\n69 + 47 - 41 + 13 = 98\n\nThis is also not 88. Let's try one more combination.\n\nIf we take 69 and subtract 13, we get 56. Then, if we add 41 and 47, we get:\n\n56 + 41 + 47 = 144\n\nThis is too high. The correct combination seems to be:\n\n69 + 41 - 47 + 13 = 86\n\nWe are close, but not quite there. The correct approach is:\n\n69 + 47 - 41 + 13 = 88\n\nThus, the equation that equals 88 is:\n\n<answer> 69 + 47 - 41 + 13 </answer>"}]

Now, I need to add something to 36 to get 47. \n\nIf I use 83 in this equation, I see that 83 - 47 = 36.

If I add 75 and 43, I get 118, which is too high. If I subtract 43 from 75, I get 32, which is too low. If I multiply 75 and 43, I get 3285, which is much too high.

Let's try adding 3 to the result:\n\n(89 * 83 / 78) - 3 + 3 = 95.8641 + 3 = 98.8641 (too high)\n\nLet's try 89 * 83 / (78 - 3) = 89 * 83 / 75 = 7447 / 75 = 99.2933 (too high)\n\nLet's try 89 * 83 / (78 + 3) = 89 * 83 / 81 = 7447 / 81 = 92.1235 (too low)\n\nLet's try 89 * 3 / (78 - 83) = 89 * 3 / -5 = -53.4 (negative, so not valid)\n\nLet's try 89 * 3 / (78 - 89) = 89 * 3 / -11 = -24.3636 (negative, so not valid)\n\nLet's try 89 * 3 / (83 - 78) = 89 * 3 / 5 = 267 / 5 = 53.4 (too low)\n\nLet's try 83 * 3 / (89 - 78) = 83 * 3 / 11 = 249 / 11 = 22.6363 (too low)\n\nLet's try 83 * (89 - 78) / 3 = 83 * 11 / 3 = 913 / 3 = 304.3333 (too high)\n\nLet's try 89 * (83 - 78) / 3 = 89 * 5 / 3 = 445 / 3 = 148.3333 (too high)\n\nLet's try 89 - (83 - 78) * 3 = 89 - 5 * 3 = 89 - 15 = 74 (too low)\n\nLet's try 89 - (83 - 78) / 3 = 89 - 5 / 3 = 89 - 1.6666 = 87.3334 (too low)\n\nLet's try (89 - 83) * 3 + 78 = 6 * 3 + 78 = 18 + 78 = 96 (This works)\n\nSo, the equation that equals 96 is (89 - 83) * 3 + 78.\n</think>\n<answer> (89 - 83) * 3 + 78 </answer>"}]

Let's try the following:\n\n1. Start with 97 and 75. The difference between them is 97 - 75 = 22.\n2. Now, we need to use 15 to get to 37.

First, consider 80 as a potential base, as it is the largest number and could be adjusted to get close to 57.\n2. We need to reduce 80 to get to 57. One way to do this is by subtracting, so we can use 45, 78, or 10.\n3. Let's try 80 - 45 = 35, which is not enough to reach 57.\n4. Now, 80 - 78 = 2, which is too small.\n5. Finally, 80 - 10 = 70, which is close but still too high.\n\nAnother approach is to add smaller numbers to reach 57 from a base number.\n6. Consider using 78 as the base and subtracting. \n7. 78 - 45 = 33, which is still not enough.\n8. 78 - 10 = 68, which is too high.\n9. 78 - 80 = -2, which is in the wrong direction.\n\nLet's consider using 45 as the base and add the others.\n10. 45 + 10 = 55, which is close but needs an additional 2.\n11.

Let's see if we can get close to 81 using division first:\n\nIf we take 97 and divide it by 14, we get 6.92857, which is close to 81 but not quite there. We can adjust this slightly by subtracting 30 from 97 and then dividing by 14 to get a closer result.\n\n97 - 30 = 67\n67 / 14 = 4.78571\n\nThis is still not 81, but it gives us an idea. Now, we need to find a way to get from 4.78571 to 81. We can do this by multiplying by 17.52, but that's not one of our numbers. Instead, we need to find a way to use 14 and 30 to get 17.52 - 14.\n\n14 * 5.5 = 77\n77 + 4 = 81\n\nSo, we can use 97 - 30 to get 67, then 67 / 14 to get approximately 4.78571, and finally 4 * 17.5 = 70, which is close to 81 but still not exact. \n\nA more straightforward approach would be:\n97 - 14 = 83\n83 - 2 = 81\n\nBut we need to use 30, so we need to adjust the equation:\n97 - 30 = 67\n67 + 14 = 81\n\nThis works, but we need to use division somehow. Let's try:\n97 - 30 = 67\n67 / 14 = 4.78571\n4.78571 * 17.5 = 83.361714, which is close but not exact.\n\nThe simplest and most accurate solution is to use:\n97 - 14 = 83\n83 - 2 = 81\n\nBut since we can't use 2, we need to use 30 in a way that gives us 2.

However, 87 alone or with simple operations with 5 or 68 doesn't get close to 14.\n- Next, let's try using division. If we divide 87 by a number, we can see if it can get close to 14. 87 divided by 6 is 14.5, which is close but not exact.\n- If we divide 87 by a slightly smaller number, it might get even closer.

This doesn't seem to be a useful intermediate step as it's not an integer.\n- Another approach is to divide 91 by 13, which gives 7.

We can form 56 using 84 and 48: \n\n- 84 - 48 = 36, and we need 20 more to reach 56. So, we can use 20 + 36 = 56.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\n70 - (84 - 48 + 20) = 14.\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n84 - 48 = 36,\n36 + 20 = 56,\n70 - 56 = 14.\n\nThus, the equation is:\n70 - (84 - 48 + 20).\n\n<answer> 70 - (84 - 48 + 20) </answer>"}]

Let's try to find a combination that works.\n\nFirst, we can see that 39 is quite close to 31, so we might use it in our equation. We can subtract 71 from 39 to get a negative number, but we need a positive 31. We can use 6 and 7 to adjust the result.\n\nIf we subtract 71 from 39, we get -32. We need to add 63 to -32 to get 31. We can use 6 and 7 to get 63 by multiplying them.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 39 - 71 + 6 * 7\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n39 - 71 = -32\n6 * 7 = 42\n-32 + 42 = 10\n\nIt seems we need to adjust.

Let's try 71 - 39 = 32, then 32 - 6 = 26, then 26 + 5 = 31. We need 5, which is 7 - 2, but we don't have 2. Let's try another approach:\n\n71 - 39 = 32\n32 - 7 = 25\n25 + 6 = 31\n\nThis works.

First, consider the largest numbers 94 and 67. Subtracting 67 from 94 gives 27, which is too large for our target.\n2. Next, consider using 64. If we subtract 64 from 67, we get 3, which is also too small. If we subtract 64 from 94, we get 30, which is still too large.\n3. We can try division: 94 divided by 67 is approximately 1.4, which is not helpful for our target.\n4. Consider 49 as a potential starting point. If we subtract 67 from 49, we get -18, which is not useful.\n5. We can try combining smaller numbers. For example, 67 - 49 = 18, and then 18 - 64/67 would be too small.\n\nA useful approach is to notice that 64 can be used as a denominator to reduce the value of the other numbers. Let's try:\n\n- (94 - 67) / 49 = 27 / 49 (too small)\n- (94 - 64) / 49 = 30 / 49 (still too small)\n- (49 - 64) / 67 = -15 / 67 (negative and too small)\n\nFinally, if we consider:\n\n- (67 - 49) / (94 - 64) = 18 / 30 = 3 / 5 (too small)\n\nThe best combination seems to be:\n\n- 64 - 67 + 49 - 94\n\nThis gives us:\n\n- -10 + 49 - 94 = 39 - 94 = -55 (not right)\n\nAfter several trials, the correct combination appears to involve division and subtraction:\n\n- (67 - 64) + (94 / 49) = 3 + (94 / 49) = 3 + 1.918367... \u2248 4.918367... (not 12)\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n- (64 / 49) + (94 - 67) = 1.306122... + 27 = 28.306122... (not 12)\n\nAfter exhausting most combinations, the correct and simplest solution turns out to be:\n\n- (67 - 49) / (94 - 64) = 18 / 30 = 3 / 5 (not 12)\n\nFinally, the correct combination is:\n\n- 67 - 64 + 49 - 94 = -10 + 49 - 94 = 39 - 94 = -55 (not 12)\n\nThe correct solution after all trials is:\n\n- (67 - 49) + (94 - 64) = 18 + 30 = 48 (not 12)\n\nAfter rechecking all combinations, the correct and simplest solution is:\n\n- (94 - 67) + (64 - 49) = 27 + 15 = 42 (not 12)\n\nThe correct and simplest solution is:\n\n- (67 - 49) / (94 - 64) = 18 / 30 = 3 / 5 (not 12)\n\nFinally, the correct solution is:\n\n- (94 - 67) - (64 - 49) = 27 - 15 = 12\n\nTherefore, the equation that equals 12 using the given numbers is:\n\n<answer> (94 - 67) - (64 - 49) </answer>"}]

Instead, we can subtract 16 from 65 and see if we can use the result:\n65 - 16 = 49\n\nNow, let's add 49 to 55:\n55 + 49 = 104\n\nThis is still too high, so we need to adjust our approach. Let's try a different combination.\n\nIf we subtract 16 from 65, we get:\n65 - 16 = 49\n\nNow, we need to find a way to use 86 and 31 to get closer to 68. We can try subtracting 49 from 86:\n86 - 49 = 37\n\nNow, we need to get from 37 to 68. We can use the remaining number, 31:\n37 + 31 = 68\n\nSo, the correct equation is:\n86 - (65 - 16) + 31 = 68\n</think>\n<answer> (86 - (65 - 16)) + 31 </answer>"}]

First, I tried using 76 and 59 as they are close to 100 and see if I can use 3 and 5 to make the difference or complement to 100.\n\n2. 76 + 59 = 135, which is too high, so we can't use both of these together.\n\n3. 76 - 59 = 17, not helpful as we can't use 17 with 3 and 5 to get 100.\n\n4. 59 - 76 = -17, which is not helpful.\n\n5.

So, we need to find a way that 8, 19, and 48 can give us 13.\n\n2. Let's try combining 8 and 19. 8 + 19 = 27, which is too high. Let's try 8 - 19, which gives -11, also too low. We need a positive value close to 13. \n\n3. Next, let's try using 48 in combination with 8 or 19. 48 - 8 = 40, which is too high. 48 - 19 = 29, which is too high. \n\n4. Now let's try a multiplication or division with 48. 48 / 8 = 6, which is too low. 48 / 19 is not an integer. \n\n5. We need to find a way to get close to 13 using 8 and 19. If we subtract 19 from 8, we get -11, which is not helpful. But, if we add 19 to 8, we get 27, which is too high. \n\n6. Let's try a different approach: 64 + 13 = 77. We need to create 13 using 8 and 19. \n\n7. If we take 19 - 8, we get 11, which is close but not quite there. \n\n8. If we take 19 - (8 / 48), this won't work as 48 is too large for division. \n\n9. Let's try 19 - (8 / 1) = 11, which is close to 13 but not exact. \n\n10. We can use 19 - (8 / 1) + 48 / 8 = 19 - 8 + 6 = 27 - 14 = 13, but this uses 48 / 8 twice.\n\n11.

The correct approach is to use 64 + (19 - 8 / 1) = 64 + 11 = 75, but since 48 / 8 = 6, it becomes 64 + 11 = 75, and we need 77.\n\n13. Finally, the correct equation is 64 + (19 - 8 / 1) = 64 + 11 = 75, but we need to add 2, and 2 = 19 - 17, and 17 = 48 / 8 * 2.\n\nSo, the equation is 64 + (19 - 48 / 8) = 77.\n\n</think>\n<answer>64 + (19 - 48 / 8)</answer>"}]

Using 84 as a divisor or in a subtraction or addition might help because it's the largest number and could simplify the equation.\n2. 10 can be used as a multiplier or divisor.\n3. 89 can be used in an addition or subtraction.\n\nLet's test some combinations:\n- 84 / 10 is 8.4, which is not close to 15.\n- 84 - 10 = 74, which is too large.\n- 84 + 10 = 94, which is too large.\n- 84 - 89 = -5, which is far from 15.\n- 89 - 84 = 5, which is too small.\n- 10 * 89 = 890, which is too large.\n- 10 * 84 = 840, which is too large.\n\nNow, let's try a combination with 10 as a multiplier and 84 or 89 as the subject of subtraction or addition:\n- (89 - 10) / 84 = 79 / 84, which is not 15.\n- (84 - 10) / 89 = 74 / 89, which is not 15.\n- (89 - 84) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50, which is too large.\n- (84 - 89) * 10 = -5 * 10 = -50, which is too small.\n\nFinally, let's try a combination with 10 as a divisor:\n- 84 / (89 - 10) = 84 / 79, which is not 15.\n- 84 / (10 - 89) = 84 / -79, which is not 15.\n\nNow, let's try a direct subtraction and addition:\n- 89 - 84 = 5, which is too small.\n- 84 + 89 = 173, which is too large.\n\nThe correct combination seems to be using 10 as a divisor and directly adding/subtracting the other numbers:\n- (89 - 84) + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nThis works as it uses each number exactly once and the operations are basic arithmetic.\n</think>\n<answer> (89 - 84) + 10 </answer>"}]

You can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and each number can only be used once. Let's work through this step by step. \n\nTo get to 14, we might want to look for combinations that can be simplified to 14. One way to approach this is to see if we can use multiplication to get close to 14 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\nOne combination that might work is using 51 and 7. If we divide 51 by 7, we get approximately 7.2857, which is close but not quite 14. We need to adjust this by using the other numbers 1 and 59.\n\nLet's try 51 divided by 7, and then add and subtract the other numbers to reach 14. \n\n51 / 7 = 7.2857, which is close, but we need to adjust it. If we subtract 1 from 7.2857, we get closer. So, let's try:\n\n51 / 7 - 1 = 6.2857, still not 14. We need to add something. \n\nAdding 59 to 6.2857 is too much, so let's try subtracting 59 instead:\n\n51 / 7 - 1 - 59 = -59.7143, which is not 14 either.\n\nWe need to rethink our approach. Let's try using addition and subtraction directly with the numbers.\n\nIf we add 7 and 1, we get 8. We need to get from 8 to 14, so we need to add 6. We can get 6 by subtracting 1 from 7, but we already used 1, so we need to find another way.\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n\n59 - 51 = 8, and 8 + 6 = 14. We can get 6 by subtracting 1 from 7:\n\n59 - 51 + (7 - 1) = 14.\n\nSo, the equation that uses each number once and equals 14 is:\n\n<answer> 59 - 51 + 7 - 1 </answer>."}]

However, it's clear that just adding or subtracting these numbers will not give us 54. Therefore, we should consider using multiplication and division.\n\nOne approach is to try to get a number close to 54 and then adjust it with another operation. Let's try to multiply 53 by a fraction that will get us close to 54. The fraction should involve 8, 28, and 36. \n\nIf we try to use 8 and 28, we can form a fraction 28/8 = 3.5. Now, if we multiply 53 by 3.5, we get 53 * 3.5 = 185.5. This is too large, so we need to adjust.\n\nAnother fraction we can try is 28/8 * 36 = 3.5 * 36 = 126. Then, 53 * 126 = 6678, which is too large.\n\nInstead, let's try a simpler approach with 28 and 36. We can form the fraction 36/28 = 1.2857, but this is not a clean fraction to use. Instead, let's try to use 8 and 36 in a more straightforward way.\n\nIf we use 36 - 8, we get 28. Now, we can use this result in a multiplication: 53 * (36 - 8) / 28 = 53 * 28 / 28 = 53. This is not 54, so we need to add 1.\n\nIf we add 1 to 53, we get 54. We can get 1 by using 8 / 8. So, the equation becomes 53 + (36 - 8) / 28 = 53 + 1 = 54.\n\nTherefore, the equation is 53 + (36 - 8) / 28 = 54.\n</think>\n<answer> 53 + (36 - 8) / 28 </answer>"}]

Multiply 14 by another number:\n   - 14 * 18 = 252 (too large)\n   - 14 * 39 = 546 (too large)\n\n5. Divide 91 by another number:\n   - 91 / 14 = 6.5 (not an integer)\n   - 91 / 18 = 5.055...

We need to find a combination that results in 99 using each number only once and basic arithmetic operations.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider multiplication and addition, as these operations can quickly increase the value of our result.\n\nLet's try multiplying 21 and 6 first:\n21 * 6 = 126\n\nNow, we need to reduce 126 to 99. We can do this by subtracting 27:\n126 - 27 = 99\n\nNext, let's see if we can use the remaining numbers (22 and 12) to get 27:\n22 - 12 = 10\n\nThis does not work. Let's try another combination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider 21 and 12 for multiplication:\n21 * 12 = 252\n\nNow, we need to reduce 252 to 99.

First, consider the numbers and their relationships. We have quite a range of numbers (37, 2, 68, 45), so we need to find a way to combine them to get close to 12.\n2. Notice that 68 is quite large compared to the other numbers, so we might want to use it in a way that reduces its value significantly.\n3. We can start by subtracting 68 from a larger number to bring it closer to 12. If we use 68 - 45, we get 23, which is still far from 12.\n4. Let's try combining 68 and 37. If we subtract 37 from 68, we get 31, which is still not close to 12.\n5. Now, let's consider using 2 in our equation. We can try dividing or subtracting it from a larger number to get closer to 12.\n6. If we use 45 - 2, we get 43, which is also far from 12.\n7. We need to find a combination that balances out to 12. Let's try using the division operation with 68 and 45. If we use 68 / 45, it's a bit more than 1, which is too small.\n8. Let's try another approach: 68 - 37 = 31, and then we need to reduce 31 to 12. We can use 2 and 45 to achieve this: 45 - 2 = 43, and then 43 - 31 = 12.\n\nSo, the equation that fits the criteria is:\n\n<think> 45 - 2 - (68 - 37) </think>\n\n<answer> 45 - 2 - (68 - 37) </answer>"}]

Let's solve this.\n\n<think>\nTo solve this, I need to use the numbers 62, 80, and 63 in such a way that the result is 80. Since 80 is already one of the numbers, I can use it as is. I need to figure out a way to use 62 and 63 to either add, subtract, multiply, or divide to get 0, so that 80 + 0 = 80.\n\nTrying out the operations:\n- (62 + 63) - 80 = 45\n- 80 - (62 + 63) = -45\n- (62 - 63) + 80 = 79\n- 80 - (62 - 63) = 81\n- (63 - 62) + 80 = 81\n- 80 - (63 - 62) = 79\n- (62 * 63) / 80 is not an integer and does not equal 80\n- 80 * (62 - 63) = -80\n- 80 + (62 - 63) = 79\n- 80 + (63 - 62) = 81\n- 80 - (63 - 62) = 79\n- (62 / 63) * 80 is not an integer and does not equal 80\n- 80 / (62 - 63) = -80\n- 80 / (63 - 62) = 80\n\nThe last operation gives us the correct result.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 80 / (63 - 62) </answer>"}]

Now, if we subtract 8 from 110, we get 102, which is too high.\n4. If we add 8 and 96, we get 104. Now, if we subtract 61 from 104, we get 43, which is too low.\n5. If we add 8 and 49, we get 57. Now, if we add 61 to 57, we get 118, which is too high.\n6. If we add 96 and 61, we get 157. Now, if we subtract 8 from 157, we get 149, which is too high.\n7. If we add 96 and 49, we get 145. Now, if we subtract 61 from 145, we get 84, which is too high.\n8. If we add 61 and 8, we get 69. Now, if we add 49 to 69, we get 118, which is too high.\n9. If we add 61 and 49, we get 110. Now, if we subtract 8 from 110, we get 102, which is too high.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that:\n\n1. If we add 8 and 49, we get 57.\n2. If we add 61 and 96, we get 157.\n3. If we subtract 57 from 157, we get 100, which is too high.\n4. If we subtract 157 from 57, we get -100, which is too low.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n1. If we add 61 and 8, we get 69.\n2. If we add 96 and 49, we get 145.\n3. If we subtract 69 from 145, we get 76.\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\n<answer>(96 + 49) - (61 + 8)</answer>"}]

Addition could help if we can get numbers close to 30.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of using 88 and 65 in a way that involves subtraction and division to reach 30.\n\nIf we take 88 - 65, we get 23. Now, we need to use 5 and 35 to get to 30. We can use division here.\n\nSo, (88 - 65) + (35 / 5) = 23 + 7 = 30.\n\nThis works, and we are using each number only once.\n</think>\n<answer> (88 - 65) + (35 / 5) </answer>"}]

We can start by looking at the possibility of using division or subtraction since these operations can help reduce large numbers to smaller values.\n2. Trying to use 98, the largest number, and subtract or divide it with the other numbers might be a good approach.\n3. Let's try 98 - 30 = 68, this is too large.\n4. Next, consider 98 - 52 = 46, still too large.\n5. Let's try using 52 - 3 = 49, still too large.\n6. Now, consider 30 - 3 = 27, again too large.\n7. Trying 52 - 30 = 22, still too large.\n8. Seeing that direct subtraction isn't working, let's try division. We can divide 98 by 7 to get 14, but we don't have 7.\n9. We can instead try 98 / 7 = 14, but again, we don't have 7.\n10. Let's try using 98 - (30 + 3) = 98 - 33 = 65, still too large.\n11. Considering multiplication, 3 * 52 = 156, too large.\n12. Let's try 3 * 30 = 90, still too large.\n13. Now, let's consider 3 * (52 - 30) = 3 * 22 = 66, still too large.\n14. We can also try 3 * (98 - 30) = 3 * 68 = 204, too large.\n15. Another possibility is 52 - 3 * 30 = 52 - 90 = -38, not the answer.\n16. Trying 98 - 3 * 30 = 98 - 90 = 8, not the answer.\n17. Finally, let's try 98 / 7 = 14, but we don't have 7.\n18. After trying different combinations, it seems we can use 98 - 85 = 13, but we need to form 85 from the numbers we have.\n19. Noticing that 52 + 33 = 85, and 33 can be formed from 30 + 3, we can finally form the equation: 98 - (30 + 3 + 52) = 13.\n\nThe equation that uses each number exactly once and results in 13 is:\n\n<think>98 - (30 + 3 + 52)</think>\n\n<answer>98 - (30 + 3 + 52)</answer>"}]

We can achieve this by:\n- 71 - 61 = 10\n- 7 * 1 = 7\n- 7 + 10 = 17\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try a different approach:\n- Use 61 and 71 directly, and manipulate the other numbers to adjust the result.\n- 71 - 61 = 10\n- We need 61 more to reach 71, and we have 1 and 7.\n- 7 * 1 = 7, and we need 54 more (71 - 10 - 7 = 54)\n- We can't use 7 and 1 to get 54 directly, so we should reconsider the initial approach.\n\nA simpler approach is:\n- 71 - 61 = 10\n- 10 * 7 = 70\n- 70 + 1 = 71\n\nThis uses all the numbers and arithmetic operations effectively.\n</think>\n<answer> (71 - 61) * 7 + 1 </answer>"}]

We can add 10 to get closer:\n\n30 + 10 = 40\n\nSo, the equation using all the numbers is 69 - (78 / 2) + 10.\n</think>\n<answer> (69 - (78 / 2)) + 10 </answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. First, consider 99 - 18 = 81, which is too high.\n2. Trying 99 - 54 = 45, which is also too low.\n3. Next, 99 - 10 = 89, still too high.\n4. Trying 99 - 18 - 54 = 27, still not 69.\n5. Now, consider 99 - 18 - 10 = 71, close but not 69.\n6. Let's try 99 - (18 * 10) = -181, not close at all.\n7. Consider 99 - (18 + 10) = 71, again not 69.\n8. Now, try 99 - (54 / 18) * 10 = 99 - 3 * 10 = 69. This works!\n\nSo, the equation is 99 - (54 / 18) * 10 = 69.\n</think>\n<answer> 99 - (54 / 18) * 10 </answer>"}]
