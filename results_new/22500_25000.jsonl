Since 70 is the largest number, it's a good starting point. We can subtract 19 and 42 from 70 to see if we get 47.\n\n70 - 19 - 42 = 70 - 61 = 9\n\nThis isn't 47, so we need to try a different approach.

Let's try another combination.\n\nNow, let's try multiplying 19 and 42 first, and then subtract from 70:\n70 - (19 * 42) = 70 - 798 = -728\n\nThis is clearly not correct. Let's try a different approach.\n\nAnother option is to use 19 and 42 to get a number close to 70, and then add or subtract from 42 to get 47.\n\nWe can start by adding 19 and 42:\n19 + 42 = 61\n\nNow, let's try to use 70 and 61 in a way that we get 47:\n70 - 61 + 42 = 49 - 42 = 7\n70 - 42 - 61 = 28 - 61 = -33\n42 + 19 - 70 = 61 - 70 = -9\n\nNone of these combinations seem to work.

Let's try dividing 70 by one of the smaller numbers and then adding or subtracting the other number.\n\n70 / 19 + 42 = 3.68 + 42 = 45.68 (close but not 47)\n70 / 42 + 19 = 1.67 + 19 = 20.67 (not 47)\n70 / 19 - 42 = 3.68 - 42 = -38.32 (not 47)\n70 / 42 - 19 = 1.67 - 19 = -17.33 (not 47)\n\nLet's try another approach.\n\nNow, let's try 70 - 19 - 42 again but in a different order:\n70 - 42 + 19 = 28 + 19 = 47\n\nThis works! \n\nSo, the equation that equals 47 using the numbers [70, 19, 42] is:\n<answer> 70 - 42 + 19 </answer>"}]

Let's try 60:\n   - 60 - 93 = -33 (too small)\n   - 60 - 97 = -37 (too small)\n\n3. Let's try 93:\n   - 93 - 97 = -4 (too small)\n\n4.

Trying to use 66 first, we can subtract 15 from it to get 51, but that's not helpful.\n2. Using 57, we can subtract 15 to get 42, and then we would need to add or multiply to reach 60.\n3. Using 48, we can add 12 to it to get 60, but we need to find a way to get 12 from the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to combine the numbers in a way that we can reach 60. We can use multiplication to get a number close to 60 and then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n- If we use 66 and 15, 66 - 15 = 51.\n- We need 9 more to reach 60. We can get 9 by dividing 48 by 5.222 (but that's not an integer operation).\n- Let's try 48 and 15: 48 - 15 = 33. We need 27 more to reach 60. We can get 27 by multiplying 57 by 0.481 (again, not an integer).\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n- If we use 57 and 15, 57 - 15 = 42. We need 18 more to reach 60. We can get 18 by multiplying 48 by 0.375 (not an integer).\n\nFinally, let's try:\n- 66 - 48 = 18. We need 42 more to reach 60. We can get 42 by multiplying 15 by 2.8 (not an integer).\n\nThe simplest and most straightforward approach is to use 48 and 12, but we can get 12 by 15 - 3, and 3 by 66 - 63, but 63 is not a number in our set. \n\nThe correct approach is:\n- 66 - 48 = 18. We need 42 more to reach 60. We can get 42 by 57 - 15.\n- So, we can combine 66 - 48 + (57 - 15) = 60.\n\nThus, the equation is: 66 - 48 + (57 - 15) = 60.\n</think>\n<answer> 66 - 48 + (57 - 15) </answer>"}]

Let's try to manipulate these numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, let's try subtraction and division, as these operations can help reduce the larger numbers to something closer to 26. \n\n46 - 14 = 32, which is close but not quite 26. \n58 - 14 = 44, which is too large.\n\nNext, let's try division.

If we divide 58 by 3, we get approximately 19.33, which is also not close enough.\n\nNow, let's try combining the numbers in a more complex way. If we subtract 14 from 46, we get 32. We need to reduce this to 26. We can do this by dividing 32 by a number that will give us 26. \n\n32 / (32 / 26) = 26. \n\nSo, we need to find a way to represent 32 / (32 / 26) using the given numbers. \n\n32 can be represented as 46 - 14. \n\nNow, we need to find a way to represent 32 / 26.

Let's try a simpler approach:\n\n46 - 58 / 2 = 46 - 29 = 17, which is not 26.\n\n58 - 46 / 2 = 58 - 23 = 35, which is too large.\n\nLet's try another combination: 58 - (46 - 14) = 58 - 32 = 26.\n\nThis works!

We can use 50 - 45 (which is 50 - 5*9, but we don't have 9, so let's try another approach).\n- Another approach is to use 50 directly and combine it with the other two numbers in a different way. If we subtract 23 from 50, we get 27. Then, if we add 56 to 27, we get 83.\n\nSo, the equation is 56 + (50 - 23).\n</think>\n<answer> (56 + (50 - 23)) </answer>"}]

Multiplication and division:\n   - 68 * 72 = 4896 (too large)\n   - 68 * 57 = 3876 (too large)\n   - 72 * 57 = 4084 (too large)\n   - 68 / 72 = ~0.94 (not an integer)\n   - 68 / 57 = ~1.19 (not an integer)\n   - 72 / 68 = ~1.05 (not an integer)\n   - 72 / 57 = ~1.26 (not an integer)\n   - 57 / 68 = ~0.84 (not an integer)\n\n4. Let's try a combination of operations:\n   - (72 - 68) * 57 = 4 * 57 = 228 (too large)\n   - (72 - 57) * 68 = 15 * 68 = 1020 (too large)\n   - (68 - 57) * 72 = 11 * 72 = 792 (too large)\n\n5. A viable approach is to use subtraction and division:\n   - (72 - 68) / 57 = 4 / 57 (not 53)\n   - 72 - (68 / 57) = 72 - 1.19 (not 53)\n\n6. Finally, let's try a combination that might work:\n   - 72 - (68 - 57) = 72 - 11 = 61 (too large)\n   - 68 - (72 - 57) = 68 - 15 = 53 (this works)\n\nThe equation that uses each number exactly once and equals 53 is 68 - (72 - 57).\n</think>\n<answer> 68 - (72 - 57) </answer>"}]

So, we can form the equation: 59 - (9 + 5) = 45.\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and the required operations.\n</think>\n<answer> 59 - (9 + 5) </answer>"}]

We can use each number only once.\n\nLet's start by trying to use multiplication to get close to 99, as 78 is the largest number and might help us reach the target:\n\n1. \\(78 \\times 1 = 78\\)\n2. \\(78 \\times 2 = 156\\) (too high)\n3. \\(78 \\times 1.294 \\approx 100\\) (not an integer)\n\nSince 78 needs to be used exactly as it is, let's try to add or subtract the other numbers:\n\n- If we subtract 8 from 78, we get 70, which is still far from 99.\n- If we add 13 to 78, we get 91, which is close but not enough.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of using 13 and 8 in a way that brings us closer to 99:\n\n- If we multiply 13 and 8, we get \\(13 \\times 8 = 104\\), which is close to 99 and we can adjust by subtracting 5.\n- We can get 5 by subtracting 8 - 3, but we don't have a 3 available. So, let's try another approach.\n\nLet's try adding 13 to 87 (which we can get by subtracting 13 from 100):\n\n- \\(78 + 13 + 8 - 8 = 99\\)\n\nThis seems to work, but we need to ensure we use each number exactly once. Let's write it out:\n\n\\[78 + 13 + (8 - 8) = 99\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[78 + 13 + 0 = 99\\]\n\nThis is correct, but we need to ensure we use the numbers 13, 8, and 78 exactly once. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Using \\(78 + 13\\) gives 91, and we need 8 to get to 99.

Trying to use subtraction and division might help, as we can reduce the larger numbers and adjust with the remaining number.\n2. Let's try using 54 and 29 first:\n   - 54 - 29 = 25, but we need to reach 42 and we have 41 left, so this doesn't work well.\n3. Let's use 54 and 41:\n   - 54 - 41 = 13, which is still far from 42, so this also doesn't work.\n4. Let's use 29 and 41:\n   - 41 - 29 = 12, which is closer, but we still need to incorporate 54.\n5. Now, let's consider multiplication and addition:\n   - 41 * 29 = 1189, which is too large.\n   - 41 * 54 = 2214, which is also too large.\n   - 29 * 54 = 1566, which is too large as well.\n6. Let's try division:\n   - 54 / 29 = 1.86 (approx), which is too small.\n   - 54 / 41 = 1.32 (approx), which is also too small.\n7. Considering 54 and 29 in a division and subtracting the result from 41:\n   - 41 - (54 / 29) = 41 - 1.86 = 39.14 (approx), which is close but not exact.\n8. Finally, let's try 54 - 29 - 41 + something:\n   - 54 - 29 - 41 = -16, which is not helpful.\n9. Consider using 41 - 29 and adjusting with 54:\n   - (41 - 29) * 54 = 12 * 54 = 648, which is too large.\n10. Now, let's try the combination 41 - 54 + 29:\n    - 41 - 54 + 29 = 16, which is still not 42.\n11. Considering another approach, let's try:\n    - (54 - 41) * 29 = 13 * 29 = 377, which is too large.\n12. Trying another approach:\n    - (41 - 29) + 54 = 12 + 54 = 66, which is too large.\n13. Now, let's try:\n    - (54 + 29) - 41 = 83 - 41 = 42, which works!\n\n</think>\n<answer> (54 + 29) - 41 </answer>"}]

Multiplication and division might be useful to get closer to 84.\n3. Addition and subtraction can be used to fine-tune the result.\n\nLet's try to use 42 and 7 in a multiplication or division operation that can help us reach 84.\n\nIf we divide 42 by 7, we get 6.

Since 84 is already in the list, we can use 7 and 42 in a way that doesn't change the value of 84.\n\nIf we multiply 7 and 42, we get 294.

We need to use these numbers exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to get 81.\n\nTrying to form 81 directly might be challenging, so let's think about how we can manipulate these numbers to get close to 81.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the possibility of adding or subtracting the numbers to get a value close to 81, or perhaps one of the numbers could be divided by another to get a close value.\n\nLet's try to see if we can get to 81 by adding or subtracting 48, 84, and 51. \n\n48 + 84 = 132, which is too large. \n\n84 - 48 = 36, which is too small. \n\nNow, let's consider multiplication and division. We could try to divide 84 by 51 and then adjust the result to get close to 81, but this doesn't seem to work directly.\n\nAnother approach is to use 84 and 51 in a way that can get us to 81. We can subtract 51 from 84 to get 33, but we still need to get to 81.\n\nLet's try to use 48 in a way that can help us. We can multiply 48 by a fraction to get close to 81.\n\nIf we divide 84 by 51, we get 1.6667, which is close to 1.5, but not quite what we need. However, if we use 84 and 51 to get a fraction that can be used with 48, we can see:\n\n(84 - 51) = 33, and if we divide 48 by 33, we get approximately 1.45, which is not exactly what we need.\n\nInstead, let's try to use 48 as a multiplier and see if we can use 84 and 51 in a way that gets us to 81.\n\nIf we try 48 * (84 / 51), we need to simplify this:\n\n84 / 51 simplifies to 28 / 17, which is approximately 1.647, and then:\n\n48 * (28 / 17) = 48 * 1.647 \u2248 79.056, which is close but not 81.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem. We need to get exactly 81, and we can use subtraction to make it work:\n\n84 - 51 = 33, and then:\n\n48 - 33 = 15, which is not what we want.\n\nInstead, let's try:\n\n84 - 48 = 36, and then:\n\n51 - 36 = 15, which is not what we want.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n84 - 51 = 33, and then:\n\n81 - 33 = 48, which works!\n\nSo, the equation is 84 - 51 + 48 = 81.</think>\n<answer>84 - 51 + 48</answer>"}]

Using it might help us get close to 79. Let's try to form 79 by adding or subtracting other numbers to 72.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Operations**:\n   - Let's start by using 72 in the equation:\n     - \\(72 + x = 79 \\Rightarrow x = 79 - 72 \\Rightarrow x = 7\\)\n     - We need to form 7 using the remaining numbers [26, 24, 57].\n\n4. **Form 7 Using Remaining Numbers**:\n   - We can see that 24 and 26 are too large, but 57 is too large as well. We need to consider combinations or operations:\n     - \\(26 - 19 = 7\\)\n     - We can try to form 19 using 24 and 57:\n       - \\(24 - 57 = -33\\), which is too small and negative.\n       - Instead, try \\(57 - 24 = 33\\), which is too large.\n       - We need a smaller combination. Let's try using division or other operations.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate Possible Combinations**:\n   - Consider using subtraction and division:\n     - \\(24 - 26 = -2\\) (too small)\n     - \\(24 - 57 = -33\\) (too small and negative)\n     - \\(26 - 57 = -31\\) (too small and negative)\n\n6. **Alternative Approach Using Multiplication and Addition/Division**:\n   - Let's use multiplication and division:\n     - \\(26 \\div 2 = 13\\)\n     - \\(13 + 24 = 37\\)\n     - \\(37 + 42 = 79\\) (using 72 - 30 = 42, but we used 72 directly)\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Use \\(72 - 24 + 57 - 26\\):\n     - \\(72 - 24 = 48\\)\n     - \\(48 + 57 = 105\\)\n     - \\(105 - 26 = 79\\)\n\n### Final Equation:\n<answer> (72 - 24) + 57 - 26 </answer>\n\nThis equation uses each number exactly once and results in 79."}]

We can see that 37 - 30 = 7, and 7 can be obtained by 30 - 23, but we don't have 23. \n\nThe only feasible and direct way is to use 37 directly and the remaining numbers in a way that doesn't alter the result.

Next, consider multiplication and division:\n   - 75 / 85 is less than 1 (too low)\n   - 85 / 75 is slightly more than 1 (too low)\n   - 11 * 75 = 825 (too high)\n   - 11 * 85 = 935 (too high)\n   - 75 / 11 is approximately 6.82 (too high)\n   - 85 / 11 is approximately 7.73 (too high)\n\n3. Now, consider a combination of operations:\n   - (85 - 75) * 11 = 10 * 11 = 110 (too high)\n   - (75 - 85) * 11 = -10 * 11 = -110 (too low)\n   - (85 - 11) * 75 = 74 * 75 = 5550 (too high)\n   - (75 - 11) * 85 = 64 * 85 = 5440 (too high)\n   - (11 - 75) * 85 = -64 * 85 = -5440 (too low)\n   - (11 - 85) * 75 = -74 * 75 = -5550 (too low)\n\n4. Finally, consider division and subtraction:\n   - (85 - 75) / 11 = 10 / 11 (too low)\n   - (75 - 85) / 11 = -10 / 11 (too low)\n   - (85 - 11) / 75 = 74 / 75 (too low)\n   - (75 - 11) / 85 = 64 / 85 (too low)\n   - (11 - 75) / 85 = -64 / 85 (too low)\n   - (11 - 85) / 75 = -74 / 75 (too low)\n\n5.

Since 96 is already present in the given numbers, we can simply use it as part of our equation.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to use the other two numbers, 13 and 12, to get a result that, when combined with 96, still equals 96. We can achieve this by adding 13 and 12 and then subtracting this sum from 96, which would give us:\n\n96 - (13 + 12) = 96 - 25 = 71\n\nHowever, this does not equal 96. Instead, we can use 13 and 12 to get a result that, when added to 96, equals 96. This can be done by subtracting the sum of 13 and 12 from itself, which will give us 0, and adding this 0 to 96:\n\n96 + (13 - 12) = 96 + 1 = 97\n\nThis is not correct either. Instead, we can use the numbers in a way that their sum or product can be used to reach 96. Considering the numbers, we can use 12 as a divisor or multiplier.

This can be done by:\n\n13 - 12 = 1\n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n\n96 * (13 - 12) = 96 * 1 = 96\n</think>\n<answer> 96 * (13 - 12) </answer>"}]

We can use the 7s in a division or subtraction operation that will not eliminate them completely.\n- One possible solution is to use the 7s in a division operation that results in 1, and then use this 1 to multiply with 11 to get 11, and finally add 73 to reach 84.\n- However, we need to use the numbers exactly as they are given, so we need to find a way to use all three numbers directly.\n- By trial and error, we can find that (11 * 7) + 7 = 77 + 7 = 84.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (11 * 7) + 7 </answer>"}]

We can also try division: \\(\\frac{84 \\times 41}{30}\\), but this does not equal 95 either.\n\nThe simplest and most straightforward combination that works is \\(84 + 41 - 30\\).\n\nTherefore, the equation is \\(84 + 41 - 30\\).\n\n<answer> 84 + 41 - 30 </answer>"}]

I should try different combinations and operations.\n\nFirst, I notice that 33 + 48 = 81, which is close to 66 but too large. Subtracting or dividing from this sum might get us to 66. Let's try:\n\n81 - 9 = 72, still too large.\n81 - 6 = 75, still too large.\n81 / 9 = 9, which is too small.\n81 / 6 = 13.5, also too small.\n\nSince adding or subtracting 9 or 6 from 81 didn't work, I should try other combinations. Now I'll consider the smaller numbers (9 and 6) as multipliers or divisors for the larger numbers (33 and 48).\n\n33 * 2 = 66, but we don't have a 2 in our numbers. So, let's try combinations with 9 and 6:\n\n(48 - 6) * 9 = 42 * 9 = 378, which is too large.\n(48 - 9) * 6 = 39 * 6 = 234, which is still too large.\n(9 - 6) * 33 = 3 * 33 = 99, which is too large.\n\nNow I realize that 33 is almost 66, and I have 48, 9, and 6 left. I should try to get 33 + 33 = 66, but obviously, I can't use 33 twice. So, I need to use 48, 9, and 6 in some way to adjust 33 to 66.\n\n48 - 9 = 39, and 39 + 6 = 45, which is still not 66.\n48 - 6 = 42, and 42 + 9 = 51, still not 66.\n9 * 6 = 54, and 33 + 54 = 87, which is too large.\n\nThe only combination that seems to work is using 33 + (48 - 9 - 6). Let's check:\n33 + (48 - 9 - 6) = 33 + 23 = 56, which is not 66.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I realize I overlooked a simpler approach: 33 + 33 = 66, but we can't repeat 33. Now, I should look for a way to get 33 using the other numbers.\n\n(48 - 9) * (6/6) = 39 * 1 = 39, which is not 33.\n(48 - 6) * (9/9) = 42 * 1 = 42, still not 33.\n\nFinally, I realize the key is to use 48 - 9 - 6 = 33, and then add this to 33:\n33 + (48 - 9 - 6) = 33 + 33 = 66.\n\nThus, the correct equation is: 33 + (48 - 9 - 6) = 66.\n\nanswer: <answer> 33 + (48 - 9 - 6) </answer>"}]

Given that 48 and 38 are fairly large numbers, multiplying them could be a good start.\n\n48 * 38 = 1824, which is much larger than 83.

For example, if we can get 79, adding 3 would give us 82, which is close to 83.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can use 3 to manipulate 48 and 38 to get 79. We can try to subtract or divide 3 from 48 or 38 in such a way that we achieve 79.\n\n48 - 3 = 45, and if we multiply 45 by 38, it's too large. So, let's try another combination.\n\n38 - 3 = 35, and if we multiply 35 by 48, it's also too large. \n\nLet's consider adding 3 to a product or quotient. \n\n48 * (38 - 3) = 48 * 35 = 1680, too large.\n\n38 * (48 - 3) = 38 * 45 = 1710, also too large.\n\nNow, let's try a different approach. We can use 38 and 48 in a way that we can subtract or add 3.\n\n48 + 38 = 86, which is close to 83.

First, we should consider the target number, which is 15.\n2. Looking at the given numbers (32, 58, 75), we need to find a combination that can lead to 15 using basic arithmetic operations.\n3. One effective strategy is to think about subtraction, as it can help reduce large numbers to smaller ones.\n4. Let's start by subtracting the smallest number (32) from the largest (75):\n   75 - 32 = 43\n5. Now we have 43 and the remaining number (58). We need to get to 15.\n6. Subtracting 58 from 43 won't work, so we should consider division or multiplication.\n7. If we divide 43 by 58, we get a number less than 1, which won't help us reach 15.\n8. Multiplying won't work either, as 43 * 58 is much larger than 15.\n9. We need to think outside the box.

We can subtract 32 from 58:\n\n58 - 32 = 26\n\nNow we need to get from 26 to 15 using 75.\n\n75 - 26 = 49 (too large)\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\n58 - 32 = 26\n75 - 26 = 49 (too large)\n\nThe correct equation is:\n\n58 - (75 - 32) = 15\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n58 - 43 = 15\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<answer> 58 - (75 - 32) </answer>"}]

We can use 72 - 27 = 45, and now we need 4 (49 - 45). \n\nWe can use 10 - 6 = 4, but we don't have a 6. \n\nLet's try 72 - 27 = 45, and then 45 - 10 = 35. \n\nWe need 14 (49 - 35). \n\nWe can use 10 + 4 = 14, but we don't have a 4. \n\nLet's try another approach. We can use 84 - 72 = 12, and now we need 37 (49 - 12). \n\nWe can use 27 + 10 = 37, and this works.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 27 + 10 - (72 - 84).\n</think>\n<answer> 27 + 10 - (72 - 84) </answer>"}]

Multiplying 31 by 6 or 4 would be too large, and dividing 31 by 6 or 4 would be too small.\n\nNext, we can consider adding or subtracting. We need to find a way to use 6 and 4 to get a number that, when combined with 31, equals 33.\n\nIf we subtract 4 from 6, we get 2. This means we need to use 31 and 2 in such a way that their combination gives 33. The simplest way is to add 2 to 31, but we need to use 6 and 4 to get this 2.\n\nSo, we can subtract 4 from 6 to get 2 and then add this to 31:\n31 + (6 - 4) = 31 + 2 = 33\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and only basic arithmetic operations.\n</think>\n<answer> 31 + (6 - 4) </answer>"}]

If we subtract 6 from 37, we get 31.

Let's try to use division and subtraction to get close to 42.\n\nOne approach is to use 77 and 24, as 77 is close to 42 and 24 can be manipulated to get the exact value. We can start by considering 77 - 24, which gives 53. Now, we need to use 58 and 69 to reduce this to 42. \n\nBy dividing 69 by 58, we get approximately 1.19, which is close to 1. So, we can use this to subtract from 53 to get closer to 42. Let's check:\n53 - (69 / 58)\n\nThis gives us:\n53 - 1.19 = 51.81, which is still not 42. So, this approach doesn't work directly. \n\nAnother approach is to consider 77 and 58. We can start by subtracting 58 from 77:\n77 - 58 = 19\n\nNow, we need to use 24 and 69 to get to 42. By dividing 69 by 24, we get approximately 2.875. Adding this to 19 gives:\n19 + (69 / 24)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n19 + 2.875 = 21.875, which is still not 42. So, this approach doesn't work directly either.\n\nFinally, let's try another combination. We can use 24 and 69, and see if we can manipulate them with 77 and 58. \n\nIf we subtract 24 from 69, we get:\n69 - 24 = 45\n\nNow, we need to use 77 and 58 to reduce this to 42. By subtracting 58 from 77, we get:\n77 - 58 = 19\n\nWe can now combine these results:\n(69 - 24) - (77 - 58)\n45 - 19 = 26, which is not 42.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, it seems we need to approach this differently. Let's try a direct subtraction and addition approach.\n\nIf we subtract 58 from 77, we get:\n77 - 58 = 19\n\nNow, we need to use 24 and 69 to get to 42. By adding 24 to 19, we get:\n19 + 24 = 43\n\nThis is close but not exactly 42. We need to adjust by subtracting 1. Since 69 - 68 = 1, and 68 is close to 69, we can use 69 - 68 to adjust. However, we don't have 68, so we need to find a way to use the numbers exactly as given.\n\nAfter reviewing all possible combinations, we find that the correct approach is:\n77 - (69 - 58) - 24\n\nLet's calculate this:\n77 - (69 - 58) - 24\n77 - 11 - 24\n77 - 35\n42\n\nSo, the equation that equals 42 using the numbers [24, 77, 58, 69] exactly once is:\n77 - (69 - 58) - 24\n</think>\n<answer> 77 - (69 - 58) - 24 </answer>"}]

We can't simply use it as 54 because we need to reach 18, which is significantly smaller. Multiplying or dividing 54 by the other numbers (6 or 9) won't help because the results would be too large (54*6 = 324, 54*9 = 486) or too small (54/6 = 9, 54/9 = 6).\n\nNext, we can try to use 6 and 9 in a way that when combined with 54, they can result in 18. If we add 6 and 9, we get 15, which is close to 18. We can use division to adjust this closer to 18.\n\nTherefore, we might consider the equation 54 / 3 = 18.

Instead, let's try another approach.\n\nConsidering the subtraction and addition of the numbers:\n\n\\(85 - 75 = 10\\)\n\nNow, if we add 43 and subtract 10, we get:\n\n\\(43 - (85 - 75) = 43 - 10 = 33\\)\n\nSo, the equation that satisfies the conditions is:\n\n<think>43 - (85 - 75)</think>\n\n<answer>43 - (85 - 75)</answer>"}]

I need to use the numbers 78, 73, and 19 to create an equation that equals 14 using basic arithmetic operations. Each number can only be used once. Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n<think>\nFirst, I will consider the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Since 78 and 73 are quite large compared to 14, it's more likely that we will need to use subtraction or division to bring these numbers down to the target value.\n\nLet's try to eliminate 78 first by subtracting it from the other numbers. If we subtract 78 from 73, we get -5, which is still far from 14. So, let's consider using 19 in our equation.\n\nNow, let's try to use 19 in a division or multiplication. If we divide 73 by 19, we get approximately 3.84, which is also not close to 14. So, we need to use 19 in a different way.\n\nLet's consider using 19 in a subtraction. If we subtract 19 from 73, we get 54, which is still not close to 14. However, if we subtract 19 from 78, we get 59, which is also not close to 14.\n\nLet's try to use 19 in a multiplication. If we multiply 19 by 14, we get 266. If we divide 266 by 78, we get approximately 3.41, which is not close to 14. If we divide 266 by 73, we get approximately 3.65, which is also not close to 14.\n\nNow, let's consider a combination of operations. If we subtract 19 from 78, we get 59. If we then subtract 73 from 59, we get -14. This is close to our target, but we need a positive 14. \n\nLet's try the other way around: if we subtract 73 from 78, we get 5. If we then add 19 to 5, we get 24. This is not close to 14, so let's try the reverse: if we subtract 73 from 78, we get 5. If we then subtract 19 from 5, we get -14. This is close, but still negative.\n\nFinally, let's try another combination: if we subtract 73 from 78, we get 5. If we then add 14 to 5, we get 19. However, we need to use 19 in our equation and only use it once, so let's try the reverse: if we subtract 73 from 78, we get 5. If we then subtract 5 from 19, we get 14. This works!\n\nSo, the equation is: 19 - (78 - 73) = 14.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 19 - (78 - 73) </answer>"}]

We can try to use multiplication or division to get a result close to 54:\n   - 51 * 50 = 2550 (too large)\n   - 51 / 50 = 1.02 (too small)\n   - 50 / 51 = 0.98 (too small)\n\n3. We can try to use addition or subtraction:\n   - 51 + 50 = 101 (too large)\n   - 51 - 50 = 1 (too small)\n   - 50 - 51 = -1 (too small)\n\n4. We need to find a combination that works. Let's try using 54 in a way that involves 51 and 50:\n   - 54 = 51 - 50 + 54 (but we can't use 54 again)\n   - 54 = 51 + 54 - 50 (but we can't use 54 again)\n\n5. Let's try a different approach:\n   - If we use 51 and 50 in a multiplication or division, we need to balance it with 54.\n   - 54 = (51 - 50) * 54 (but we can't use 54 again)\n\n6. Finally, let's try:\n   - 54 = (51 - 50) * (51 + 50 - 54)\n   - 54 = 1 * (51 + 50 - 54)\n   - 54 = 1 * (51 + 50 - 54)\n   - 54 = 1 * (97 - 54)\n   - 54 = 1 * 43 (which is not correct)\n\n7.

This gives us an idea to use 53 / 13 and then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nBy adjusting, we can use:\n53 / 13 + 79 - 50 = 37\n\nLet's verify:\n53 / 13 = 4.0769\n4.0769 + 79 = 83.0769\n83.0769 - 50 = 33.0769 (This is not correct, so we need to adjust)\n\nAnother approach is to use:\n53 - 13 = 40\n40 - 79 + 50 = 37 (This is not correct)\n\nLet's try:\n53 - 13 - 79 + 50 = 37\n53 - 13 = 40\n40 - 79 = -39\n-39 + 50 = 11 (This is not correct)\n\nLet's try another approach:\n53 - 79 + 13 + 50 = 37\n53 - 79 = -26\n-26 + 13 = -13\n-13 + 50 = 37\n\nThis works.

We can use 27 - 23 (which is not possible as we do not have 23), or we can use 32 - 28 (which is not possible as we do not have 28).\n\n8. The best approach seems to be using 27 and 32 in a combination that can get us close to 90. Let's try 32 - 22 = 10, then multiply by 9. We can get 9 by using 27 - 18.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n32 - 22 = 10\n27 - 18 = 9\n10 * 9 = 90\n\nTherefore, the equation is (32 - 22) * (27 - 18).\n</think>\n\n<answer> (32 - 22) * (27 - 18) </answer>"}]

Since 45 is less than 55, we need to find a way to increase the result by 10. We can achieve this by using multiplication or division, but given the numbers, it seems more feasible to use multiplication.\n\nIf we multiply 4 by 34, we get 136, which is too large. However, we can use 34 and 4 in a way that brings us closer to 55. If we subtract 4 from 34, we get 30. Now, we need to find a way to use the remaining numbers (5 and 2) to get from 30 to 55.\n\nOne way to do this is to multiply 30 by 1.8333, but since we can only use whole numbers and basic arithmetic, let's try another approach. We can use the fact that 55 - 30 = 25. \n\nNow, we need to see if we can get 25 using 5 and 2. We can achieve this by multiplying 5 and 5 (which gives 25) and then adjusting with the 2. However, since we only have one 5, we need to use the 2 in a way that doesn't interfere with the 4 and 34.\n\nThe simplest way is to use (5 * 4) + 34 - 2 = 20 + 34 - 2 = 52. Then, we need to add 3 to get 55. But we don't have a 3, so we need to rethink.\n\nLet's try: (34 - 4) * 2 + 5 = 30 * 2 + 5 = 60 + 5 = 65, which is too much. We need to adjust.\n\nFinally, we can use: (34 - 4) * 2 - 5 = 30 * 2 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\n\nThus, the equation is (34 - 4) * 2 - 5 = 55.\n<answer>(34 - 4) * 2 - 5</answer>"}]

Let's try 88 - (18 - 2) * 6. \n88 - (18 - 2) * 6 = 88 - 16 * 6 = 88 - 96 = -8, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try 88 - 18 + 2 - 6. \n88 - 18 + 2 - 6 = 70 + 2 - 6 = 72 - 6 = 66, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try 88 - 18 + 2 * 6. \n88 - 18 + 2 * 6 = 88 - 18 + 12 = 70 + 12 = 82, which works.\n\nSo the correct equation is 88 - 18 + 2 * 6.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 88 - 18 + 2 * 6 </answer>"}]

We could subtract from 88 to get 34, which means we need 88 - 34 = 54. So, we need to find a way to make 54 using 6, 25, and 16.\n\nTrying to make 54 using 6 and 25:\n- 6 * 25 = 150 (too large)\n- 25 * 6 = 150 (too large)\n- 6 + 25 = 31 (close, but not enough)\n- 25 - 6 = 19 (not close)\n- 25 / 6 = 4.17 (not an integer)\n\nNow, let's try 6, 16, and 25:\n- 6 * 16 = 96 (too large)\n- 16 * 6 = 96 (too large)\n- 25 + 16 = 41 (too large)\n- 25 - 16 = 9 (not close)\n- 16 - 25 = -9 (not close)\n- 25 / 16 = 1.56 (not an integer)\n\nNow let's try combining all three numbers in different ways:\n- (25 - 6) * 16 = 320 (too large)\n- (25 + 6) * 16 = 464 (too large)\n- (25 - 6) / 16 = 1.19 (not an integer)\n- (25 + 6) / 16 = 2.19 (not an integer)\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try a different approach with 88:\n- 88 - 6 = 82 (too large)\n- 88 - 25 = 63 (too large)\n- 88 - 16 = 72 (too large)\n- 88 - (6 + 25 + 16) = 41 (too large)\n\nIt seems that the direct subtraction approach is not working. Let's consider multiplication and division:\n- 88 / 6 is not an integer\n- 88 / 25 is not an integer\n- 88 / 16 is not an integer\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to use each number exactly once, let's re-evaluate the combination:\n- (88 - 25) / 6 = 113 / 6 (not an integer)\n- (88 - 16) / 6 = 72 / 6 = 12 (too small)\n- (88 - 6) / 16 = 82 / 16 (not an integer)\n\nFinally, let's consider:\n- 88 - (25 - 6) * 16 = 88 - 344 / 16 = 88 - 21.5 (not an integer)\n\nAfter thorough evaluation, it seems the combination using these numbers and the given operations doesn't directly yield 34. However, a possible solution can be found using a different approach:\n- 6 * (25 - 16) = 6 * 9 = 54\n- 88 - 54 = 34\n\nThus, the equation is 88 - 6 * (25 - 16) = 34.\n</think>\n<answer>88 - 6 * (25 - 16)</answer>"}]

Now, let's try combining addition or subtraction with multiplication or division:\n   - (60 + 61) * 36 / 44 = 121 * 36 / 44 = 4356 / 44 = 99\n\nThus, we have found a combination that works: (60 + 61) * 36 / 44.\n\n<answer> (60 + 61) * 36 / 44 </answer>"}]

So, let's consider using subtraction or division to make a number closer to 59.\n\nLet's consider the number 68. We need to reduce it to 59. We can do this by subtracting 9. However, 9 isn't one of our numbers, so we need to find a way to make 9 using our numbers.\n\nLooking at the other numbers, we can see that 37 - 3 = 34, which is close but not quite 9. This doesn't immediately help, so let's think about other operations.\n\nNotice that 68 - 40 = 28. Now, if we can get 9 from the remaining numbers (3 and 37), we can add this to 28 to get 59.\n\nWe can use 37 - 3 = 34, but we need 9, not 34. However, we can use division to get 37 - 3 = 34, and then 34 / 4 (which isn't possible with our numbers) won't work.

We can get 9 by 40 - 37 = 3, and then multiply by 3 to get 9 (since 3 * 3 = 9).\n\nSo, we can write the equation as 68 - (40 - 37) * 3.\n\n<think>\n1. Start with 68.\n2.

We need to use these numbers exactly once and combine them with basic arithmetic operations to get 64.\n\nOne way to approach this is to look for combinations that can lead us to 64. \n\nWe can start by considering how we might use the number 80. Since 80 is close to 64, we can try to subtract or divide it to get 64. However, using subtraction would leave us with a large number that is hard to manipulate, and division would require a divisor that is not among our numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to see if we can use the number 26 in a way that it can help us reach 64. One way to do this is to consider the number 26 as a potential factor or subtractor. \n\nLet's try the following equation: \n\n<think> 80 - 26 - 2 - 2 = 50, which is not 64, so this approach is not working. </think>\n\n<think> Instead, let's try to use multiplication. 80 / 2 = 40, and we need 24 more to reach 64. Using the remaining numbers 26 and 2, we can get 26 - 2 = 24. </think>\n\n<think> So, combining these, we can form the equation: 80 / 2 + (26 - 2) = 64. </think>\n\n<answer> 80 / 2 + 26 - 2 </answer>"}]
