Starting with 34, the simplest approach might not work since it's significantly larger than 24, and dividing or subtracting it from other numbers would likely not get close to 24.\n2. Considering 27, if we multiply it by a fraction of 34 or 85, we might get close to 24. However, 27 * (34/85) is not an integer.\n3. If we subtract or add 27 to/from 34 or 85, we still don't get 24.\n4. A better approach is to consider 85 and see if we can manipulate it with the other numbers to get 24. If we subtract 27 from 85, we get 58. Then, if we divide 58 by 34, we get 1.705882353, which is not 24.\n5. Let's try another combination: 85 - 34 = 51. Now, if we divide 51 by 27, we get 1.888888889, which is not 24.\n6. The key is to use 27 in a way that helps us get to 24. If we subtract 27 from 85, we get 58. Now, if we divide 58 by 34, we get 1.705882353, which is not 24.

But we can't use 31 directly.\n- If we try \\( 47 + 14 = 61 \\), we need to add 3 to get to 64. So, we can use \\( 61 + 3 = 64 \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation we need is:\n\\[ 47 + 14 + 3 = 64 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer> 47 + 14 + 3 </answer>"}]

We have the numbers 93, 25, and 26.\n2. We need to use these numbers exactly once to form an equation that equals 94.\n3. The target is 94, so we should consider if we can use 93 and adjust it slightly using the other numbers.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- Adding 26 to 93 would give us 119, which is too much.\n- Subtracting 26 from 93 would give us 67, which is too little.\n- Multiplying 25 by 26 would give us 650, which is also too much.\n- Dividing 25 by 26 would give us a fraction, which won't help us reach 94.\n\nGiven the above, the best approach seems to involve adding a small adjustment to 93 using 25 and 26. We can use 25 and 26 in a way that the result is 1 when combined with 93 to get 94.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to subtract 25 from 26, which gives 1, and then add that 1 to 93.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n93 + (26 - 25)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<answer> 93 + (26 - 25) </answer>"}]

We need to use the numbers 83, 54, and 82 to get 53.\n2. The numbers are quite large, so we might need to subtract or divide to get a smaller result.\n3. Subtracting 54 from 83 gives us 29, which is still too large.\n4. Subtracting 82 from 83 gives us 1, which is too small.\n5. Subtracting 82 from 54 gives us -28, which is in the right ballpark but not quite there.\n6. We can try combining operations. If we subtract 82 from 83 and then subtract 54 from that result, we get: (83 - 82) - 54 = 1 - 54 = -53.\n7. To get to 53, we need to adjust our approach.

Let's try a combination of addition and multiplication or division.\n\n- (14 + 13) / 56 = 0.4107 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n- (14 + 56) / 13 = 5\n- (14 * 13) / 56 = 3.0357 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n- (14 * 56) / 13 = 59.2308 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n- (13 * 56) / 14 = 56\n- (56 * 14) / 13 = 58.4615 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nFinally, let's try the combination 56 / 14 + 13:\n- 56 / 14 + 13 = 4 + 13 = 17\n\nThis combination works and gives us the desired result of 17.\n</think>\n<answer> 56 / 14 + 13 </answer>"}]

Subtracting 28 from 90 gives us 62.\n- So, we can form the equation: \\( 15 \\times 6 - 28 = 62 \\).\n\nThus, the equation is \\( 15 \\times 6 - 28 = 62 \\).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer> 15 * 6 - 28 </answer>."}]

We need to find a way to use 9 and 7 to get from 49 to 33.\n\nLet's try division or multiplication with the remaining numbers:\n- 7 * 9 = 63, which is too high.\n- 7 / 9 is much less than 1, so it won't help us get closer to 33.\n- 9 / 7 is also less than 1.\n\nThe only operation that seems promising is subtraction:\n- 49 - 7 = 42, which is still not 33.\n- 49 - 9 = 40, still not 33.\n\nLet's try using 30 in a different way:\n- 79 - 30 = 49\n- Now, 49 - 7 - 9 = 33\n\nSo, the equation is 79 - 7 - 9 - 30 = 33.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 79 - 7 - 9 - 30 </answer>"}]

If we use 7 as a multiplier, 56 * 7 is too large. So, let's try division:\n\n56 / 7 = 8, which is not what we want. \n\nInstead, let's try to form 56 using 69 and 13 and then use 7:\n69 - 13 = 56, and 56 - 7 = 49, which is not 63.\n\nNow, let's try another approach:\nIf we use 69 - 13, we get 56. We need 7 more to get 63. We can use 7 in a way that adds to 56:\n\n56 + 7 = 63\n\nSo, the correct equation is 69 - 13 + 7 = 63.\n</think>\n<answer> 69 - 13 + 7 </answer>"}]

But we don't have the number 2, so we need to use the remaining number, 36, in some way to get 2.\n\nIf we divide 36 by 18, we get 2, but we can't use 18. Instead, we can use 19 - 17 = 2, but we need to find a way to get 17 from the numbers we have.\n\nIf we subtract 36 from 79 - 19, we get:\n79 - 19 - 36 = 24\n\nNow we need to get to 62 from 24.

Let's explore the possible combinations:\n\n1. Trying multiplication and addition: We can't directly multiply the numbers to get 96.\n2. Trying multiplication and subtraction: We can't get 96 by subtracting one from the product of the others.\n3. Trying division and addition/subtraction: Division won't help as it would result in fractions or small numbers.\n4. Using a combination of operations: We can try to use subtraction or addition in conjunction with multiplication or division.\n\nLet's look at the numbers and try a combination:\n- 56 * 9 = 504, which is too large.\n- 56 * 49 = 2744, which is also too large.\n- 49 * 9 = 441, which is also too large.\n\nNow, let's try to get close to 96 by using subtraction or addition in a different way:\n- (56 + 49) = 105, which is close but not quite there.\n- (56 - 49) = 7, which is too small.\n\nConsidering the numbers again, let's use division and addition:\n- 56 / 49 = 1.142857, which is not helpful.\n- 49 / 9 = 5.444444, which is also not helpful.\n\nA different approach might be to use subtraction in the context of multiplication:\n- 56 * (9 + 49/56) = 56 * 10.892857 = 607.02, which is too large.\n- 56 * (9 - 49/56) = 56 * 8.142857 = 454.02, which is too large.\n\nFinally, let's try a combination with subtraction:\n- 56 + 9 * 49 - 100 = 56 + 441 - 100 = 397, which is too large.\n\nThe correct approach seems to be:\n- 56 + 9 + 49 = 114, which is too large.\n- 56 - 9 + 49 = 96.\n\nTherefore, the equation that uses each number only once and results in 96 is:\n56 - 9 + 49\n\n<answer> 56 - 9 + 49 </answer>"}]

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of using division, as it can help in getting closer to the target number with the given inputs.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest number, 54. If we use it as the base, we need to find a way to get closer to 66 using 21 and 33. We can try to divide 54 by a smaller number to see if we can get a result close to 1.2, because 54 * 1.2 = 64.8, which is very close to 66.\n\nWe can see that 21 / 33 is not a good option because the result is less than 1, and we would need to multiply it by 54 to get a value much smaller than 54. Instead, let's consider the inverse, 33 / 21, which is approximately 1.57, and see if we can use it in a way that gets us to 66.\n\nIf we multiply 54 by (33 / 21), we get:\n54 * (33 / 21) = 54 * (33 / 21) = 54 * 1.5714 \u2248 85.55, which is too high.\n\nInstead, we can subtract (33 / 21) from 54 to see if we get closer to 66:\n54 - (33 / 21) = 54 - 1.5714 \u2248 52.4286, which is still not 66.\n\nLet's try another approach. We can add 21 and 33 to see if we can use 54 in a way that balances the equation to 66.\n\n54 - (21 + 33) = 54 - 54 = 0, which is not helpful.\n\nInstead, let's try to use 54 in a way that balances the equation to 66 by subtracting a smaller number:\n54 - (33 - 21) = 54 - 12 = 42, which is not 66.\n\nFinally, let's try to use 54 and 21 in a multiplication, and then add 33:\n(54 / 21) * 33 = (2.5714) * 33 = 84.857, which is too high.\n\nThe best approach seems to be to use 54 and 21 in a subtraction, and then add 33:\n54 - 21 + 33 = 33 + 33 = 66.\n\nThus, the equation is 54 - 21 + 33 = 66.\n</think>\n<answer> 54 - 21 + 33 </answer>"}]

Instead, we can subtract 24 from 73 to get 49, which is too low.\n4. Another approach is to subtract 24 from 95, which gives us 71. Adding 22 to 71 gives us 93.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is 95 - 24 + 22.\n</think>\n<answer> 95 - 24 + 22 </answer>"}]

We can use division to get a smaller number and then multiply to try to reach 16.\n\n- 64 / (63 - 59) = 64 / 4 = 16 (this works)\n\nSo, the equation that uses all three numbers and equals 16 is 64 / (63 - 59).\n</think>\n\n<answer> 64 / (63 - 59) </answer>"}]

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. First, let's see if we can use multiplication or division to get close to 72.\n2. If we multiply 82 and 86, we get 7096, which is too large.\n3. Another approach is to use subtraction. If we subtract 13 from 89, we get 76, which is close to 72.\n\nSo, we can use 89 - 13 = 76. Now, we need to adjust this result to get 72. We can do this by dividing 76 by some number that will bring it down to 72. However, none of the remaining numbers (82, 86) can be used directly in this context.\n\nLet's try combining the remaining numbers in a different way:\n- If we take 82 - 86, we get -4, which is a small number. We can try adding this to our previous result:\n  (89 - 13) + (82 - 86) = 76 - 4 = 72.\n\nThis combination works.

We need to use each number [81, 55, 29] exactly once and get the result as 55.\n2. The simplest way to achieve this is to use one of the numbers as it is since it already equals 55 (55 - 0 = 55).\n3.

Consider 51 / 17 = 3 (but we don't have 17).\n\nLet's try a different combination:\n1. Consider (51 - 38) * (89 - 51) = 13 * 38 = 494, which is not 33.\n2.

If we divide 54 by 24, we get 2.25, which is not useful here.\n\nThe simplest approach seems to be:\n90 - (54 - 24) = 90 - 30 = 60\n\nSo, the equation using the numbers 54, 90, and 24 is:\n90 - (54 - 24)\n</think>\n<answer> 90 - (54 - 24) </answer>"}]

If we use 4, we can try to get a number close to 80 by multiplying.\n\nIf we divide 37 by 4, we get 9.25, which is too small. However, if we multiply 4 and 37, we get 148, which is too large but gets us in the right direction.\n\nLet's use 37 and 4 in a multiplication format and then adjust with 68:\n37 * 4 = 148\nNow, we need to find a way to reduce 148 to 80 by using 68. If we subtract 68 from 148, we get 80.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 37 * 4 - 68 = 80\n</think>\n<answer> 37 * 4 - 68 </answer>"}]

We need to use all four numbers: 30, 93, 58, 57.\n2. The target number is 64.\n3. We can use any of the four basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\n1. 93 is the largest number, so we might want to subtract it and see what we get.\n2. Trying 93 - 30 = 63, which is close but not quite 64.\n3. We can add 58 to 63 to get 121, which is too high.\n4. We can subtract 58 from 63 to get 5, which is too low.\n5. Let's try 93 - (30 - 58) = 93 - (-28) = 93 + 28 = 121 (still too high).\n6. Let's try 93 - (30 - 57) = 93 - (-27) = 93 + 27 = 120 (still too high).\n7. Let's try 93 - (58 - 30) = 93 - 28 = 65 (still too high).\n8. Let's try 93 - (57 - 30) = 93 - 27 = 66 (still too high).\n\nNone of these work, so let's try a different approach:\n\n1. 58 is a significant number close to 64.\n2. 58 + 6 = 64.\n3. We need to create 6 from the remaining numbers (30, 93, 57).\n\nLet's try:\n1. 57 - 30 = 27 (too high)\n2. 93 - 57 = 36 (too high)\n3. 93 - 58 = 35 (too high)\n4. 30 - 27 = -3 (too low)\n\nNow, let's try combining these:\n\n1. (57 - 30) / 93 = 27 / 93 = 1/3 (too low)\n2. (93 - 57) / 30 = 36 / 30 = 1.2 (too low)\n3. (93 - 58) / 30 = 35 / 30 = 1.1667 (too low)\n4. (30 - 57) / 93 = -27 / 93 = -1/3 (too low)\n\nAfter several attempts, we notice that we can simply subtract 57 from 93 to get 36, then divide by 30 to get 1.2, and finally add 58 to get 64. \n\nLet's check:\n\n(93 - 57) / 30 + 58 = 36 / 30 + 58 = 1.2 + 58 = 59.2 (still not 64)\n\nAfter rechecking, it seems we need to go back to simpler combinations:\n\n(58 - 30) + (93 - 57) = 28 + 36 = 64\n\nTherefore, the equation that equals 64 using the given numbers is:\n\n<answer> (58 - 30) + (93 - 57) </answer>"}]

We notice that 51 is very close to 53, so we can start by adding or subtracting the other numbers to reach 53. \n\nLet's try using 51 as the base and see if we can use the other numbers to get to 53:\n- If we add 71 to 51, we get 122, which is too large.\n- If we subtract 71 from 51, we get -20, which is too small.\n- If we add 50 to 51, we get 101, which is also too large.\n- If we subtract 50 from 51, we get 1, which is too small.\n\nWe can also try multiplication and division, but these seem less likely to give us a result close to 53.\n\nAnother approach is to use 50 in a way that brings us closer to 53. We can subtract 50 from 83 to get 33, which is too small, or add 50 to 51 to get 101, which is too large. However, we can use 50 to bridge the difference between 51 and 53. \n\nWe can subtract 50 from 83 to get 33, then add 20 to 51 to get 71, and notice that 71 - 20 = 51. We can achieve this by using 83 - 50 = 33, and then we need to find a way to get 20 from the remaining numbers. \n\nSince 71 - 51 = 20, we can use these numbers to form the equation 83 - 50 + (71 - 51) = 53. </think>\n<answer> (83 - 50) + (71 - 51) </answer>"}]

One way to approach this is to look for a combination that either directly or indirectly involves subtraction and addition.\n\n3. Notice that 88 is significantly larger than 36, so we might want to use it in a way that reduces its value. One way to do this is by using division or subtraction.\n\n4.

Since the numbers 2 and 2 are the same, I can only use one of them in the equation. I should aim to use the larger numbers (82 and 52) in a way that leads to 13. \n\nOne possible way is to use subtraction and division. I can start by subtracting 52 from 82, which gives 30.

Let's think through the solution step by step. \n\nTo achieve 13, we need to find a combination of the given numbers that, when subjected to arithmetic operations, results in 13. Let's consider the numbers and operations:\n\n1. Start by checking if any of the numbers can be directly manipulated to get 13. None of them are 13, so we need to combine them.\n2. Consider the possibility of using division or subtraction to reduce the numbers to 13.\n3. Let's try combining 58 and 21. If we subtract 21 from 58, we get 37, which is still not 13.\n4. Another approach could be to use 41 and 25. If we subtract 25 from 41, we get 16, which is also not 13.\n5. Now, let's try combining 25 and 21, and then adjust with the remaining numbers. If we subtract 21 from 25, we get 4. We need to adjust this to 13. We can use 41 and 58.\n6. If we divide 58 by 4 (which is 21 - 17, but we can use 25 - 21), we get 14.5, which is close but not exact. We need to find a way to get exactly 13.\n7. Let's try another combination: 58 - 41 = 17. We need to adjust 17 to 13. We can use 25 - 21 = 4. If we divide 17 by 1.25, we get 13.75, which is not exact.\n8. Another combination: 41 - 25 = 16. We need to adjust 16 to 13. We can use 21 - 25 + 41 = 37, and then adjust. If we use 58 - 37 = 21, we can get closer. \n\nAfter several attempts, we find that a valid combination is: (58 - 41) - (25 - 21) = 13.\n\nSo, the equation using the numbers [25, 21, 41, 58] that equals 13 is: \n\n<answer> (58 - 41) - (25 - 21) </answer>."}]

If we subtract 81 from 23, we get a negative number, which isn't helpful. If we divide 23 by 81, we get a fraction, which isn't useful either.\n\nInstead, we can try a different approach. We need to find a way to use 81 in a way that will help us reach 58. If we subtract 59 from 81, we get 22. Now, we need to use 22 and 82 to get 58.

One way to do this is to subtract 22 from 80, but we don't have 80. Instead, we can consider the inverse: we need to add 36 to 22 to get 58.

Given the numbers 98, 62, 67, and 15, we can start by considering the largest number, 98, and see if it can be used in a way that helps us reach 88.\n\nOne approach is to use subtraction, because 98 is close to 88.

We need to try different combinations to see which one works.\n\nFirst, let's consider using 16 directly. That leaves us with the numbers 77, 49, and 4. We need to manipulate 77 and 49 to get a number that, when combined with 4, results in 16.\n\nOne way to approach this is to see if we can use 77 and 49 to get a number close to 12, because 12 + 4 = 16. \n\n77 - 49 = 28, which is too large.\n77 - (49 / 4) = 77 - 12.25 = 64.75, which is also too large.\n(77 / 49) * 4 = 1.5714 * 4 = 6.2856, which is too small.\n77 - (49 * 4) = 77 - 196 = -119, which is too small.\n\nNow, let's try another approach. If we consider 49 - 77, we get a negative number, which is not beneficial in this context.

We can use 16 itself and see if we can balance the equation with the remaining numbers.\n\nIf we take 16 and subtract 4, we get 12. We need to find a way to get 4 from 77 and 49.\n\n(49 - 77) / 4 = -28 / 4 = -7, which is not helpful.\n(77 - 49) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7, which is too large.\n(77 + 49) / 4 = 126 / 4 = 31.5, which is too large.\n\nSince none of these direct operations worked, we need to consider the numbers in a different combination.\n\nIf we take 49 - 77, we get -28. We need to find a way to use 4 and 16 with this result.\n\n-28 + 4 * 16 = -28 + 64 = 36, which is too large.\n-28 + (4 * 16) / 4 = -28 + 16 = -12, which is too small.\n\nThe only combination that seems to work is:\n49 - 77 + 16 = -28 + 16 = -12, which is too small, and\n49 - 77 - 4 + 16 = -28 - 4 + 16 = -16 + 16 = 0, which is not correct.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, the only correct equation that uses each number once and results in 16 is:\n(77 - 49) + (16 - 4) = 28 + 12 = 40, which is too large.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(77 - 49) - (16 - 4) = 28 - 12 = 16.\n\n</think>\n<answer>(77 - 49) - (16 - 4)</answer>"}]

Multiplying 84 by 17 would be too large (1428), so we consider other combinations.\n4. Multiplying 84 by 39 is also too large (3276).\n5. Multiplying 84 by 77 is even larger (6468).\n6.

We might need to use subtraction or division to adjust the result to 86.\n\nLet's try combining the numbers in different ways:\n- 32 * 3 = 96 (too high)\n- 32 * 18 = 576 (too high)\n- 18 * 3 = 54 (too low)\n\nConsidering the above, a combination of addition and multiplication seems more promising. Let's try:\n\n(32 * 3) + 18 = 96 + 18 = 114 (too high)\n(32 * 18) + 3 = 576 + 3 = 579 (too high)\n\nNow trying with subtraction:\n\n32 * (18 - 3) = 32 * 15 = 480 (too high)\n\nIt seems we need to use division or a combination that includes all numbers.\n\n(32 / 3) * 18 is not useful as 32/3 is not an integer.\n\nNow, let's try:\n\n32 * 3 - 18 = 96 - 18 = 78 (not 86)\n\nCombining in another way:\n\n32 * (18 / 3) = 32 * 6 = 192 (too high)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n32 + 18 * 3 = 32 + 54 = 86\n\nThis combination works. So, the equation is 32 + 18 * 3.\n</think>\n<answer>32 + 18 * 3</answer>"}]

(94 - 58 - 42) / 76 = -4 / 76 = -0.053 (not 34)\n5. (94 - 76 - 58) / 42 = -40 / 42 = -0.952 (not 34)\n6. (94 - 76 - 42) / 58 = -24 / 58 = -0.414 (not 34)\n7. (94 - 58 - 42) * 76 = 4 * 76 = 304 (not 34)\n8. (94 - 76 - 58) * 42 = -40 * 42 = -1680 (not 34)\n9. (94 - 76 - 42) * 58 = -24 * 58 = -1392 (not 34)\n10. (94 - 58 - 42) + 76 = 4 + 76 = 80 (not 34)\n11. (94 - 76 - 58) + 42 = -30 + 42 = 12 (not 34)\n12. (94 - 58 - 42) + 76 = 4 + 76 = 80 (not 34)\n13. 94 - (42 + 58 - 76) = 94 - 24 = 70 (not 34)\n\nAfter trying these combinations, it seems that none of the direct operations work. Let's try a different approach:\n\n94 - 42 - 58 + 76 = 70 - 58 + 76 = 12 + 76 = 88 (not 34)\n\nNow, let's try another combination:\n94 - 42 - (58 - 76) = 94 - 42 - (-18) = 94 - 42 + 18 = 52 + 18 = 70 (not 34)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n(94 - 58) - (42 - 76) = 36 - (-34) = 36 + 34 = 70 (not 34)\n\nIt seems we need a more complex combination. Let's try:\n(94 - 58) / (76 - 42) = 36 / 34 = 1.059 (not 34)\n\nAfter trying several combinations, it appears that a simple combination of the numbers using the given operations does not yield 34. However, we can use a more complex combination:\n(94 - 58) / (42 - 76) = 36 / (-34) = -1.059 (not 34)\n\nFinally, let's try:\n(94 - 76) + (58 - 42) = 18 + 16 = 34\n\nThis combination works. So the equation is:\n(94 - 76) + (58 - 42) = 34\n</think>\n<answer> (94 - 76) + (58 - 42) </answer>"}]

I will try different combinations of arithmetic operations to see which one works.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the possibility of using subtraction and division:\n- If I subtract 15 from 19, I get 4. Then, if I divide 43 by 17, I get approximately 2.529, which is not close to 14.\n- If I use 19 - 17, I get 2. Dividing 43 by 2 gives 21.5, which is close but not 14.\n- If I use 19 - 43, that won't work since it's negative and division by 17 won't give 14.\n\nNext, I'll try multiplication and subtraction:\n- If I multiply 15 by 17, I get 255, which is too large.\n- If I multiply 15 by 19, I get 285, which is also too large.\n- Trying 15 * 43 gives 645, which is not close.\n\nNow, let's try a combination of addition and subtraction:\n- Using 19 - 15 gives 4. Then, multiplying 43 by 17 gives 731, which is too large.\n- Using 17 - 15 gives 2. Multiplying 43 by 2 gives 86, which is too large.\n\nFinally, I'll try a combination using division and subtraction:\n- If I divide 43 by 17, I get approximately 2.529. Subtracting 15 from 19 gives 4. Then, 4 - 2.529 is not 14.\n- If I divide 19 by 17, I get approximately 1.118. Subtracting 15 from 43 gives 28. Then, 28 - 1.118 is not 14.\n\nAfter trying several combinations, I realize that a simple subtraction and division combination might not be the solution. Instead, I should consider using the numbers in a different order or a different operation.\n\nUpon further examination, I notice that if I use 19 - 17, I get 2. Then, I can take 43 and divide it by 15, giving approximately 2.867. Subtracting 2.867 from 2 does not yield 14.\n\nThe key is to use subtraction and division in a different order:\n- First, subtract 15 from 19, which gives 4.\n- Then, divide 43 by 17, which gives approximately 2.529.\n- Subtract the result of the division from the result of the subtraction:\n  4 - (43 / 17) = 4 - 2.529 = 1.471, which is not 14.\n\nAfter rechecking, I realize that the correct combination is:\n- Subtract 17 from 19, which gives 2.\n- Then, divide 43 by 15, which gives approximately 2.867.\n- Finally, subtract the result of the division from the result of the subtraction:\n  2 - (43 / 15) = 2 - 2.867 = -0.867, which is not 14.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that the correct combination is:\n- Subtract 15 from 43, which gives 28.\n- Then, subtract 17 from 19, which gives 2.\n- Finally, divide 28 by 2, which gives 14.\n\nSo the equation is: (43 - 15) / (19 - 17) = 14.\n<answer> (43 - 15) / (19 - 17) </answer>"}]

One way is to add, subtract, multiply, or divide these numbers to get 0, which would leave 37 unchanged.\n\nLet's try subtraction first:\n69 - 64 = 5, but we don't have 64.\n\nLet's try addition:\n69 + 5 = 74, which is too large.\n\nLet's try multiplication:\n69 * 5 = 345, which is too large.\n\nLet's try division:\n69 / 5 = 13.8, which is not an integer and doesn't help directly.\n\nGiven these attempts, the simplest approach is to use 69 - 32 = 37. But we don't have 32. The only way to use 5 effectively with 69 is to subtract it:\n69 - 5 = 64, which is close but not equal to 37.\n\nSince directly subtracting or adding 5, 37, and 69 doesn't work, let's consider the possibility of using division. We can use 69 and 5 to get 13, and then somehow use 37 to balance the equation.\n\n69 / 5 = 13.8 (not an integer, so not useful).\n\nWe need to get 13 and use 37:\n37 - 13 = 24. \n\nWe can get 13 from 69 / 5, but we need to adjust to get 24.

Each number can only be used once.\n\nFirst, consider the possibility of using two 54s. We can subtract 6 from 84 and then manipulate the results with the 54s to reach 90.\n\n\\[ 84 - 6 = 78 \\]\n\nNow we need to find a way to use the two 54s to get from 78 to 90. Let's try dividing one 54 by the other and then adding or subtracting:\n\n\\[ 54 \\div 54 = 1 \\]\n\nAdding 1 to 78 gives us 79, which is close but not 90. We need to find a way to use the numbers more effectively.\n\nLet's try another combination, using multiplication and subtraction:\n\n\\[ 54 - (54 - 6) = 54 - 48 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, add 84 to 6:\n\n\\[ 84 + 6 = 90 \\]\n\nSo, the equation using all the numbers once is:\n\n\\[ 84 + (54 - (54 - 6)) = 90 \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ 84 + (54 - 48) = 84 + 6 = 90 \\]\n\nThis confirms our equation is correct.\n</think>\n<answer> 84 + (54 - (54 - 6)) </answer>"}]

I will start by trying with multiplication and addition as they can quickly increase the value of the expression.\n\nTrying with 24 * 6 = 144, which is too high. So, I'll need to subtract or divide to get closer to 45.\n\nNow, trying 24 * 6 - 19 = 144 - 19 = 125, still too high.\n\nNext, I'll try 24 * 6 - 16 = 144 - 16 = 128, still too high.\n\nLet's try a different combination. Multiplying 24 and 19 gives 456, which is also too high.\n\nNow, let's try 24 * 19 - 6 = 456 - 6 = 450, which is still too high.\n\nSo, let's try 24 * 16 - 6 = 384 - 6 = 378, still too high.\n\nAnother combination: 24 + 19 + 16 = 59, which is too low.\n\nLet's try 24 * 6 + 19 = 144 + 19 = 163, which is too high.\n\nFinally, let's try 24 * 6 + 16 - 19 = 144 + 16 - 19 = 161 - 19 = 142, still too high.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, it looks like no simple combination works. I'll need to recheck my calculations and try another approach.\n\nAnother approach: 24 + 19 + 6 * 4 = 24 + 19 + 24 = 67, still too high.\n\nFinally, I'll try: 24 * 19 / 6 + 16 = 456 / 6 + 16 = 76 + 16 = 92, still too high.\n\nAfter rechecking, it seems there's no simple combination. I might have missed something.\n\nFinal check: 24 + 19 + 6 + 16 = 65, still too high.\n\nI need to use subtraction: 24 * 19 - 6 * 16 = 456 - 96 = 360, still too high.\n\nFinal check: 24 + 19 + 6 - 16 = 33, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 + 19 - 6 + 16 = 53, still too high.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 + 6 + 16 = 27, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 - 6 + 16 = 15, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 + 6 - 16 = 5, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 + 19 - 6 - 16 = 11, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 + 19 - 16 - 6 = 21, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 + 16 - 6 = 15, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 - 16 + 6 = -5, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 - 6 - 16 = -17, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 - 19 - 6 - 16 = -17, still too low.\n\nFinal check: 24 * 16 / 6 - 19 = 64 - 19 = 45, this works.\n\nSo, the equation that equals 45 is 24 * 16 / 6 - 19.</think>\n<answer>24 * 16 / 6 - 19</answer>"}]

We can subtract a number from 80 to get 40, or we can divide or multiply the other numbers in a way that results in a value which, when combined with 80, gives us 40.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to subtract 80 from 120, but we don't have 120. Another way is to consider 80 - (some value) = 40, which simplifies to 40 = 80 - 40. We can get 40 from 48 - 8, and 8 can be derived from 88 / 11, but 11 is not one of our numbers.

This gives us 97 - (320 / 50) = 97 - 6.4 = 90.6, which is too high.\n\nAnother approach is to use 50 in a similar way. If we subtract 50 from 87, we get 37. So, 97 - 50 = 47, which is not 37. We can try to use 50 in a multiplication or division to get closer to the necessary value.\n\nLet's try 97 - (50 * 8 / 40). This gives us 97 - (400 / 40) = 97 - 10 = 87. This works perfectly.\n\nThus, the equation is 97 - (50 * 8 / 40) = 87.\n</think>\n<answer> 97 - (50 * 8 / 40) </answer>"}]

Finally, let's try to use 69 and 53 with 6:\n   (69 - 53) * 6 = 16 * 6 = 96 (too high)\n   (69 - 53) / 6 = 16 / 6 = 2.67 (not an integer)\n   (53 - 69) * 6 = -16 * 6 = -96 (too low)\n   (53 - 69) / 6 = -16 / 6 = -2.67 (not an integer)\n\n6. The only combination that seems to work at first glance is using 69 and 6:\n   (69 - 6) * 8 = 63 * 8 = 504 (too high)\n\n7. Now, let's try a different approach:\n   (69 + 53) - (8 * 6) = 122 - 48 = 74 (this works!)\n\n</think>\n<answer> (69 + 53) - (8 * 6) </answer>"}]

We have four numbers: 2, 16, 90, and 15.\n2. We need to use these numbers exactly once to create an equation that equals 14.\n3. We can use basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's start by considering different combinations and operations:\n\n- Using 16 and 90 alone won't get us close to 14, so we should consider using all four numbers.\n- We might need a mix of addition/subtraction and multiplication/division to reach 14.\n\nLet's try a few potential combinations:\n\n1. (16 * 2) - 90 = -64 (too low)\n2. (15 * 2) - 90 = -60 (too low)\n3. (16 * 15) / 90 = 2.67 (not an integer, and too high)\n4. (90 - 16) / 2 = 37 (too high)\n5. (15 * 2) + 16 - 90 = -44 (too low)\n6. (90 - 16) - 15 = 59 (too high)\n7. (16 * 90) / 15 - 52 = 88 (too high)\n\nAfter trying several combinations, we realize we need to approach it differently. Let's consider using division and subtraction:\n\n- (90 / 16) * 2 - 15 = 5.625 - 15 (not an integer)\n\nFinally, let's try a different approach:\n\n- (16 * 2) + 15 - 90 = 32 + 15 - 90 = -43 (too low)\n\nUpon further consideration, we can try:\n\n- (90 / 15) * 2 - 16 = 6 * 2 - 16 = 12 - 16 = -4 (too low)\n\nAfter evaluating several combinations, we find:\n\n- (16 * 2) - 90 + 15 = 32 - 90 + 15 = -58 + 15 = -43 (too low)\n\nFinally, we can consider:\n\n- (16 - 2) * 15 / 90 = 14 * 15 / 90 = 14 * 1/6 = 14/6 = 7/3 (not 14)\n\nAfter exhausting these combinations, we find the right combination:\n\n- (16 * 2) - 90 + 15 = 32 - 90 + 15 = -58 + 15 = -43 (too low)\n\nFinally, we find the correct equation:\n\n- (16 - 2) * (15 / 90) = 14 * (1/6) = 14/6 = 7/3 (not 14)\n\nFinally, we find the correct answer:\n\n- (16 - 2) + (15 - 90/15) = 14 + 1 = 14\n\nAfter re-evaluating, we find the correct equation:\n\n(16 / 2) + (90 / 15) = 8 + 6 = 14\n\nThus, the correct equation is:\n\n<answer>(16 / 2) + (90 / 15)</answer>"}]

We can try different combinations to see if we can form the equation.\n\nLet's start by trying to use 95 and 94 in a way that we can get 93:\n\n- If we subtract 94 from 95, we get 1: \\( 95 - 94 = 1 \\)\n- Now, we need to use 93 to get 93. Adding 1 to 93 gives us 94, but we need 93. Instead, we can multiply 93 by 1, which gives us 93.\n\nSo, combining these steps, we get:\n\\[ 93 \\times (95 - 94) = 93 \\times 1 = 93 \\]\n\nThus, the equation that equals 93 using the numbers [93, 95, 94] is:\n<answer> 93 * (95 - 94) </answer>"}]

Let's break it down:\n\n1. We can't use 67 directly because it's much larger than 95, so we should consider using it in a subtraction or division context.\n2. We can combine 1 and 2 to get 3 or 2, but it seems more reasonable to use 1 and 2 together in a more complex operation.\n3. 20 can be used in multiplication to increase the value, or in division to reduce the value.\n\nLet's try to form the equation:\n- If we use 67 and subtract something, we might be able to get close to 95.\n- We can use 20 in multiplication to get a base value closer to 95.\n- Using 1 and 2 together in a way that doesn't reduce the value too much.\n\nA possible approach is:\n67 - 20 + (2 * 1)\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n67 - 20 = 47\n47 + (2 * 1) = 47 + 2 = 49\n\nThis doesn't work.

Let's try:\n67 + (20 * 2) - 1\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n20 * 2 = 40\n67 + 40 = 107\n107 - 1 = 106\n\nThis is not 95.

So the equation would be 14 - (92 - 92) * 5.\n\n<think>\n1. Start with 14.\n2. Subtract the result of (92 - 92) which is 0.\n3.

I can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways to see if I can get close to 84.\n\nFirst, I can try adding and subtracting the numbers:\n- 65 + 52 - 2 = 115\n- 65 + 58 - 2 = 121\n- 52 + 58 - 2 = 108\n- 65 - 2 + 52 = 115\n- 65 - 2 + 58 = 121\n- 52 - 2 + 65 = 115\n- 58 - 2 + 65 = 121\n\nNone of these combinations work. Let's try multiplication and division:\n\n- (65 * 2) / 52 = 2.5\n- (65 * 2) / 58 = 2.24\n- (65 * 52) / 2 = 1660\n- (65 * 58) / 2 = 1895\n- (52 * 58) / 2 = 1496\n- (52 * 58) / 65 = 49.15\n- (58 * 52) / 65 = 46.38\n- (52 * 65) / 58 = 55.17\n- (58 * 65) / 52 = 69.23\n\nNone of these combinations work either. Let's try a combination of addition and multiplication:\n\n- 52 + (65 * 2) / 58 = 52 + 2.76 = 54.76\n- 58 + (65 * 2) / 52 = 58 + 2.5 = 60.5\n- 58 + (52 * 2) / 65 = 58 + 1.62 = 59.62\n- 52 + (58 * 2) / 65 = 52 + 1.81 = 53.81\n\nNone of these combinations work. Let's try a different approach:\n\n- 65 + 52 - 58 / 2 = 65 + 52 - 29 = 88\n- 65 + 52 - (58 / 2) = 65 + 52 - 29 = 88\n- 65 + (52 - 58) * 2 = 65 + (-6) * 2 = 65 - 12 = 53\n- 65 + (58 - 52) * 2 = 65 + 6 * 2 = 65 + 12 = 77\n\nNone of these combinations work. Let's try one more:\n\n- 65 - 58 + 52 * 2 = 65 - 58 + 104 = 109 - 58 = 51\n- 52 - 58 + 65 * 2 = 52 - 58 + 130 = 124 - 58 = 66\n\nFinally, I tried:\n\n- 58 + 65 - 52 / 2 = 58 + 65 - 26 = 97 - 26 = 71\n- 58 + 65 - (52 / 2) = 58 + 65 - 26 = 97 - 26 = 71\n- 58 + (65 - 52) * 2 = 58 + 13 * 2 = 58 + 26 = 84\n\nThis combination works.
