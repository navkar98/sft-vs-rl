Now, let's try multiplication:\n   - 28 * 33 = 924, which is too much.\n   - 28 * 73 = 2044, which is also too much.\n\n4. Let's try division:\n   - 73 / 28 = 2.607 (approx.), which is not a useful result.\n   - 33 / 28 = 1.178 (approx.), which is also not a useful result.\n\n5. Finally, let's try a combination of addition and subtraction:\n   - 73 - 28 = 45, and 45 + 23 = 68, but we don't have 23.\n   - 73 - 33 = 40, and 40 + 28 = 68. This works!\n\nSo, the equation is 73 - 33 + 28 = 68.\n</think>\n<answer> 73 - 33 + 28 </answer>"}]

We can start by trying to use subtraction or addition to get close to 63.\n2. One approach is to subtract a smaller number from a larger number, then adjust with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n- Start with 50 and subtract a smaller number.\n- Then use the remaining numbers to reach 63.\n\nFor example, let's try:\n50 - 11 = 39\nNow we need to get from 39 to 63 using 43 and 41.\n\n39 + 43 = 82 (too high)\n39 + 41 = 80 (still too high)\n39 + (43 - 41) = 39 + 2 = 41 (too low)\n\nSince 43 and 41 don't work directly, let's try another approach:\n\n50 - 43 = 7\nThen we need to get from 7 to 63 using 11 and 41.\n\n7 + 41 = 48 (too low)\n7 + 11 = 18 (too low)\n7 + (41 - 11) = 7 + 30 = 37 (still too low)\n\nSince these approaches aren't working, let's try a different combination:\n\n50 - 41 = 9\nThen we need to get from 9 to 63 using 43 and 11.\n\n9 + 43 = 52 (too low)\n9 + 11 = 20 (too low)\n9 + (43 - 11) = 9 + 32 = 41 (still too low)\n\nSince none of these direct approaches are working, let's try another method:\n\n50 + 11 = 61\nThen we need to get from 61 to 63 using 43 and 41.\n\n61 + 43 = 104 (too high)\n61 + 41 = 102 (too high)\n61 + (43 - 41) = 61 + 2 = 63 (this works)\n\nSo the equation is 50 + 11 + (43 - 41) = 63.\n\nThe final answer is <answer> 50 + 11 + (43 - 41) </answer>."}]

If we subtract 5 from 6.6, we get a number less than 16, so we need to invert the subtraction to addition.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 66 / 10 + 5 - 1 = 16\nBut we can simplify it by removing the unnecessary subtraction of 1, as we only have three numbers and we must use each exactly once. Let's check if 66 / 10 + 5 works:\n\n66 / 10 = 6.6\n6.6 + 5 = 11.6\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach. We can use the fact that 66 - 50 = 16, and 50 can be formed by 10 * 5.

We can't use it directly as it's already larger than 50, so we need to manipulate it or use the other numbers in combination with it.\n\nNext, let's try to use 18. If we divide 78 by 18, we get 4.333, which is close to 4, but not exactly what we need.\n\nThen, let's try to use 46. If we subtract 18 from 46, we get 28. This is still not what we need, but it gives us a starting point.\n\nNow, let's combine these thoughts. We know 78 needs to be reduced to a number that, when combined with 18 and 46, equals 50. If we subtract 18 from 78, we get 60. Then, if we subtract 46 from 60, we get 14. However, we need to add 36 to 14 to get 50.\n\nSo, we need to find a way to add 36 using the numbers we have. We can do this by multiplying 18 by 2, but we don't have a 2. Instead, we can use 46 - 18 to get 28, and then add 8 to it to get 36. However, we don't have an 8 directly, but we can get 8 by dividing 78 by 9.5, which isn't straightforward with our given numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to use 78 - 18 = 60, and then 60 - 46 + 18 = 32, and we need 18 more to reach 50, which we can get by using 18 directly.\n\nTherefore, the equation is: 78 - 46 + 18 = 50.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 78 - 46 + 18 </answer>"}]

We can use 35 - 21 = 14.\n\nSo, combining these, we can form the equation: 35 - (72 / 58 * 5).\n\nLet's check the calculation:\n35 - (72 / 58 * 5) = 35 - (1.241 * 5) = 35 - 6.205 = 28.795, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try another approach: 72 - 58 = 14, and 14 + 7 = 21, but we need to use 35 somehow.\n\nNow, let's try 72 / (58 - 35) = 72 / 23, which is approximately 3.13, and 21 - 3.13 = 17.87, which is not correct.\n\nFinally, let's try 35 - (72 - 58) = 35 - 14 = 21, which works.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is 35 - (72 - 58).\n</think>\n<answer> 35 - (72 - 58) </answer>"}]

We can use the equation: 43 - (43 - 5) = 43 - 38 = 5, then multiply by 16.25 to get 81, but this does not use basic arithmetic operations as required.\n\nThe correct approach seems to be: 43 + (43 - 5) = 43 + 38 = 81.\n\nSo, the equation is 43 + (43 - 5) = 81. </think>\n\n\nuser\n<answer> 43 + (43 - 5) </answer>"}]

We can do this by using 81 - 77, which equals 4, and then we need 65 more to reach 73.\n\nLet's construct the equation:\n- We know 81 - 77 = 4.\n- To get 69, we can use 77 - 4 = 73.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 77 - (81 - 77).\n\n<answer> 77 - (81 - 77) </answer>"}]

We can start by trying to get close to 73 using one of the numbers and then adjust with the other two.\n\nLet's try the following approach:\n- We can start with 92 and see if we can adjust it using the other two numbers to get 73.\n\nLet's use the following steps:\n- Subtract 51 from 92 to get 41.\n- Add 70 to 41, but this would give us 111, which is too high.\n- Instead, we can subtract 18 from 70 to get closer.\n\nNow, let's see if we can use 51 and 70 to get 18:\n- Subtract 51 from 70 to get 19, which is close but not exactly 18.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n- We can subtract 19 from 92, which gives us 73.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n92 - (70 - 51) = 73\n\nLet's verify:\n92 - 19 = 73\n\nThus, the equation that uses the numbers 70, 51, and 92 to equal 73 is 92 - (70 - 51).\n\n<answer> 92 - (70 - 51) </answer>"}]

We notice that 89 is quite large, and we need to reduce it significantly to reach 54. Also, 55 is close to 54, which suggests it might be a part of the solution.\n\nIf we subtract 55 from 89, we get 34. This is still far from 54, so we need to make further adjustments. Notice that if we subtract 20 from 34, we get 14, which is still not 54. However, if we add 40 to 14, we get 54. \n\nSince we can only use each number once and 40 is not among our given numbers, we need to find another way to get 40. We can multiply 20 by 2, but since 2 is not among our given numbers, we need to find a way to use the numbers we have to get 40.\n\nLet's try another approach: Instead of subtracting 55, let's use it to get closer to 54. If we subtract 55 from 89, we get 34. Now, we need to find a way to add 20 to 34 to get 54. We can add 20 to 34 directly to get 54.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 89 - 55 + 20 = 54.\n</think>\n<answer> 89 - 55 + 20 </answer>"}]

If we divide 87 by 15, we get 5.8, which is not an ideal solution.\n\n7. If we divide 87 by 41, we get 2.12, which is also not ideal.\n\n8. We can try to use 87 in a different way. If we subtract 15 from 87, we get 72. Now, if we subtract 41 from 72, we get 31.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 87 - 15 - 41 = 31.\n</think>\n<answer> 87 - 15 - 41 </answer>"}]

Next, I can try multiplying and adding:\n   - (17 * 26) + 66 = 452 (too high)\n   - (17 * 26) - 66 = 398 (too high)\n   - (17 * 46) + 66 = 812 (too high)\n   - (17 * 46) - 66 = 748 (too high)\n   - (66 * 26) + 17 = 1733 (too high)\n   - (66 * 26) - 17 = 1699 (too high)\n   - (66 * 46) + 17 = 3049 (too high)\n   - (66 * 46) - 17 = 3019 (too high)\n\n3. Finally, I can try dividing and adding/subtracting:\n   - 66 / 26 + 17 = 21.5 + 17 = 38.5 (too low)\n   - 46 / 26 + 17 = 1.77 + 17 = 18.77 (too low)\n   - 66 / 17 + 46 = 3.88 + 46 = 49.88 (too low)\n   - 66 / 17 - 46 = 3.88 - 46 = -42.12 (too low)\n   - 46 / 17 + 66 = 2.71 + 66 = 68.71 (too high)\n   - 46 / 17 - 66 = 2.71 - 66 = -63.29 (too low)\n   - 17 / 66 + 46 = 0.26 + 46 = 46.26 (too low)\n   - 17 / 66 - 46 = 0.26 - 46 = -45.74 (too low)\n\nNone of the above combinations worked, so I need to think of a different approach. I notice that 66 - 46 = 20, and if I add 43, I get 63. I can create 43 by using 17 and 26: 26 + 17 = 43. Therefore, 66 - 46 + (26 + 17) = 63.\n\nSo the equation is: 66 - 46 + 26 + 17 = 63\n</think>\n<answer> 66 - 46 + 26 + 17 </answer>"}]

Let's start by considering the largest number, 75. We can subtract smaller numbers from it to get closer to 45:\n75 - 64 = 11\nNow we have 11, and we need to use 2 and 17 to make 45.

We can't get -28 using 64 and 17, so let's try another combination.\nAnother approach is to use multiplication. Let's try:\n75 * 2 = 150\nNow we need 45 - 150, which is -105.

Let's consider the operations and how they can be applied.\n\nFirst, let's consider if we can use 58 in the equation. Since 36 is smaller than 58, we can't use 58 as it is because subtracting or dividing it will result in a number less than 36. So, we need to use 58 in a way that it contributes positively to the target number.\n\n1. If we multiply 24 and 2, we get 48. Now, we need to reduce this by 12 to get 36. We can use 58 - 48 = 10, but we need to use 58 in a different way.\n\n2. Another approach is to use 58 as a positive contributor. If we subtract 24 from 58, we get 34.

We can use 47 - 42 = 5, but we can't use 42.\n\nAnother way is to use 71 - 47 = 24, and then 50 - 24 = 26.\n\nSo, the correct equation is 71 - 47 + (50 - 24) = 26.\n\nHowever, we need to simplify it to use only basic arithmetic operations and the given numbers.\n\nThe simplest way is: 50 - (71 - 47) = 26.\n\nThis uses each number exactly once and the basic arithmetic operations.\n</think>\n<answer> 50 - (71 - 47) </answer>"}]

But we need to use 52 and 7 in a way that we can reach 15.\n\nThe correct equation is: (59 - 7) - 15 = 42 - 15 = 27, which is not correct.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n(59 - 52) * 7 = 7 * 7 = 49, which is not correct.\n\nAfter several trials, the correct equation is: (59 - 52) + 15 = 7 + 15 = 22, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct equation is: (59 - 52) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct equation is: (59 - 52) + (15 - 7) = 7 + 8 = 15.\n</think>\n<answer> (59 - 52) + (15 - 7) </answer>"}]

Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n- If we subtract 13 from 40, we get 27. Then, subtracting 37 from 27 doesn't work as it results in a negative number.\n- Dividing 40 by 13 or 37 doesn't yield a whole number close to 16.\n- Multiplying 13 and 37 together gives 481, which is too large.\n- Multiplying 40 by 13 gives 520, which is also too large.\n- Multiplying 40 by 37 gives 1480, which is way too large.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most promising approach seems to be using subtraction and division. Let's try:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40 - 13}{37} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the difference inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \\]\n\nThen, divide by 37:\n\n\\[ \\frac{27}{37} \\]\n\nThis does not equal 16.

Trying to make 96 using addition/subtraction and multiplication:\n   - 12 * 11 = 132, then add 19: 132 + 19 = 151 (too high)\n   - 19 * 11 = 209, then subtract 12: 209 - 12 = 197 (too high)\n   - 19 * 12 = 228, then subtract 11: 228 - 11 = 217 (too high)\n\n3. Another approach: \n   - 19 * 12 = 228, then 228 / 11 = 20.727 (not an integer)\n   - 19 * 11 = 209, then 209 / 12 = 17.4167 (not an integer)\n   - 12 * 11 = 132, then 132 / 19 = 6.947 (not an integer)\n\n4. Let's try 19 * (12 - 11):\n   - 12 - 11 = 1\n   - 19 * 1 = 19 (not 96)\n\n5. Trying 12 * (19 - 11):\n   - 19 - 11 = 8\n   - 12 * 8 = 96 (this works)\n\nSo the equation that uses 12, 11, and 19 to equal 96 is 12 * (19 - 11).\n</think>\n<answer>12 * (19 - 11)</answer>"}]

Let's try 71 - 14, which gives us 57. We need to use 68 in a way to get 11. 57 - 68 = -11, which is too small. 57 / 68 is less than 1, which is not 11. 57 + 68 = 125, which is too large.\n\n3. Now let's try 68 - 14, which gives us 54. We need to use 71 in a way to get 11. 54 - 71 = -17, which is too small. 54 / 71 is less than 1, which is not 11. 54 + 71 = 125, which is too large.\n\n4. Let's try 14 - 68, which gives us -54. We need to use 71 in a way to get 11. -54 + 71 = 17, which is too large. -54 / 71 is less than -1, which is not 11.\n\n5. Now, let's try 68 - 71, which gives us -3. We need to use 14 in a way to get 11. -3 + 14 = 11, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, the equation is 68 - 71 + 14 = 11.\n</think>\n<answer> 68 - 71 + 14 </answer>"}]

Let me address each part separately.\n\nFor the equation problem, here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n<think>\nWe need to use the numbers 16, 94, and 91 to create an equation that equals 48. Let's try different combinations.\n1. If we add 16 and 94, we get 110. Subtracting 91 from 110 gives us 19, which is not 48.\n2. If we subtract 16 from 94, we get 78. Subtracting 91 from 78 gives us -13, which is not 48.\n3. If we add 16 and 91, we get 107. Subtracting 94 from 107 gives us 13, which is not 48.\n4. If we subtract 94 from 91, we get -3. Adding 16 to -3 gives us 13, which is not 48.\n5. If we multiply 16 and 91, we get 1456. Dividing 1456 by 94 gives us about 15.4946, which is not 48.\n6. If we divide 94 by 16, we get about 5.875. Multiplying 5.875 and 91 gives us about 535.125, which is not 48.\n7. If we subtract 94 from 16, we get -78. Adding 91 to -78 gives us 13, which is not 48.\n8. The correct combination is: (94 - 91) * 16 = 3 * 16 = 48.\n</think>\n\nFor the second part of your question about whether\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u6280\u672f (vehicle networking technology) includes autonomous driving, the answer is that vehicle networking technology can support autonomous driving systems, but it is not the same as the autonomous driving function itself. Vehicle networking technology involves the communication between vehicles and infrastructure, which can be used to enhance safety, efficiency, and information exchange. Autonomous driving, on the other hand, is a specific set of features that allows a vehicle to operate without human intervention.\n<answer> (94 - 91) * 16 </answer>"}]

However, this doesn't work directly, so we need to find another way.\n\nAnother approach is to use 49 - 33 = 16. We need to form 33 using the numbers 90, 47, and 76.\n\nLet's try 90 - 47 - 76 = -33, which is not what we want. We need a positive 33. Instead, we can try 90 - 76 + 47 = 51, which is too large.\n\nWe can also try 90 - 47 - 76 + 49 = 16. This seems to work.\n\nSo, the equation is 90 - 47 - 76 + 49 = 16.\n\nAnswer: <answer> 90 - 47 - 76 + 49 </answer>"}]

Let's try another combination with multiplication:\n\nTrying (85 - 34) * (9 / 82):\n85 - 34 = 51\n9 / 82 is approximately 0.11, so 51 * 0.11 is approximately 5.61, which is far from 40.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, the correct approach seems to be 82 - 34 + 9 - 85. Let's verify:\n82 - 34 = 48\n48 + 9 = 57\n57 - 85 = -28\n\nThis is not 40 either. Let's try 82 - 34 - 85 + 9:\n82 - 34 = 48\n48 - 85 = -37\n-37 + 9 = -28\n\nThis is not 40. Finally, let's try 85 - 34 + 9 - 82:\n85 - 34 = 51\n51 + 9 = 60\n60 - 82 = -22\n\nThis is also not 40. After considering all these, it seems we might have missed a combination. Let's try 82 - 34 - 85 + 9:\n82 - 34 = 48\n48 - 85 = -37\n-37 + 9 = -28\n\nThis is not 40. The correct combination might be 82 - 34 + 9 - 85, but let's double-check the arithmetic carefully.\n\n82 - 34 = 48\n48 + 9 = 57\n57 - 85 = -28\n\nIt seems we need to re-evaluate the approach. Let's try 85 - 34 + 9 - 82:\n85 - 34 = 51\n51 + 9 = 60\n60 - 82 = -22\n\nThis is not 40. The correct combination might be 9 * (85 / 82) - 34:\n9 * (85 / 82) = 9 * 1.0366 = 9.33\n9.33 - 34 = -24.67\n\nThis is not 40. The correct combination might be 82 - 85 + 9 + 34:\n82 - 85 = -3\n-3 + 9 = 6\n6 + 34 = 40\n\nThis works. The equation is 82 - 85 + 9 + 34 = 40.\n</think>\n<answer> 82 - 85 + 9 + 34 </answer>"}]

The number 87 is quite large and might not be easily used in a direct way to get to 30, so I'll consider using it in a division or subtraction. \n\nLet's try 34 - 47 first, which equals -13. This is too low, so we need to increase it. Adding 24 to -13 gives us 11, which is still too low. \n\nNow, let's try another combination. If we use 87 - 47, we get 40, which is close but still too high. \n\nNext, let's try 87 - 24, which equals 63. This is too high. \n\nNow, let's try 87 - (34 - 24). This equals 87 - 10, which is 77. This is still too high. \n\nLet's try 87 - (34 - 47). This equals 87 - (-13), which is 87 + 13, resulting in 100. This is too high. \n\nFinally, let's try 87 - (34 + 24). This equals 87 - 58, which is 29. This is close but not quite 30. \n\nNow, let's try using multiplication or division. If we use 34 - 47, we get -13. If we multiply this by -3, we get 39, which is close. \n\nLet's try 34 * (47 / 87). This equals 34 * 0.54 = 18.36, which is too low. \n\nFinally, let's try 87 - (34 * 24 / 47). This equals 87 - (816 / 47), which equals 87 - 17.44, resulting in 69.56. This is too high. \n\nAfter trying several combinations, the correct way to use these numbers to get 30 is to use 87 - (34 + 47 - 24). This equals 87 - 57, resulting in 30. \n\n<answer> 87 - (34 + 47 - 24) </answer>"}]

Let's try a different combination:\n74 - (79 - 2) = 74 - 77 = -3\n\nThis is also incorrect. Let's try a combination that involves division:\n79 - 74 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nThis is not 64. We need to find a correct combination. Let's try:\n74 - (79 - 74) = 74 - 5 = 69\n\nThis is close but not 64. We need one more step:\n74 - (79 - 74) - 2 = 69 - 2 = 67\n\nThis is still not 64. Let's try one more combination:\n74 - (79 - 74) - 2 + 74 = 69 - 2 + 74 = 141\n\nThis is also incorrect. Let's try a simpler approach:\n74 - 10 = 64\n\nWe need to find 10 from the remaining numbers:\n79 - 74 = 5\n5 * 2 = 10\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n74 - (79 - 74) * 2 = 74 - 5 * 2 = 74 - 10 = 64\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is:\n74 - (79 - 74) * 2\n</think>\n<answer> 74 - (79 - 74) * 2 </answer>"}]

But we don't have 8 or 10 directly, so we need to think of ways to get these using our numbers.\n\nA good strategy is to use 79 and 59. If we subtract 59 from 79, we get 20. Now, we need to use 22 in a way that helps us reach 90. We can multiply 22 by 4 to get 88, and then subtract 20 to get 68.

We might want to use it in a way that it doesn't exceed 80 when combined with other numbers. \n\nIf we subtract 18 from 78, we get 60.

Subtracting 60 from 56 would give a negative number, which is not useful here. \n\nMultiplying 60 by 56 would give a much larger number, and dividing 60 by 56 would give a small number. \n\nThe only viable option seems to be adding 20 to 60, which would give us 80.

Adding 88 to 47 is too much, so let's try subtracting:\n47 - 88 = -41\n\nThis is also not close to 58. \n\nLet's try a different combination:\nIf we add 68 and 21, we get:\n68 + 21 = 89\n\nNow we need to use 99 and 88 to get from 89 to 58. Subtracting 89 from 99 gives us 10:\n99 - 89 = 10\n\nAdding 48 to 10 would give us 58, but we don't have the number 48. \n\nLet's try:\nIf we subtract 21 from 68, we get 47. Then, if we subtract 99 from 88, we get -11:\n88 - 99 = -11\n\nNow, if we add 47 and -11, we get:\n47 + (-11) = 36\n\nThis is not what we want. \n\nLet's try:\nIf we subtract 88 from 99, we get 11. Then, if we subtract 21 from 68, we get 47:\n99 - 88 = 11\n68 - 21 = 47\n\nNow, if we add 11 and 47, we get:\n11 + 47 = 58\n\nThis works. So the equation is:\n99 - 88 + 68 - 21 = 58\n</think>\n<answer> 99 - 88 + 68 - 21 </answer>"}]

We know that 76 is significantly larger than 38, so subtracting or dividing by 76 is not feasible. Similarly, 70 is also larger than 38, so we likely won't be using it as a whole number. This leaves us with 35, which is close to 38 and could be a key part of our equation.\n\nGiven that 35 is close to 38, we can consider the operations that are necessary to get from 35 to 38. Addition or multiplication are the only operations that can get us closer to 38 using 76 or 70, but since 35 is close, let's see if subtracting or adding a small number can get us to 38. \n\nSubtracting 76 from 70 and 35 will not work as it will yield large negative or positive numbers. Dividing 35 by 76 or 70 will yield a fraction, which is not what we need. The only viable option is to see if we can use 76 in a way that it doesn't dominate the result and that 35 can be adjusted by the remaining number.\n\nOne way to use 76 is to divide it in such a way that it results in a usable fraction. If we divide 76 by 2, we get 38, but we only have 35, not 70, so this is not directly possible. We need to consider how to use 35 and the remaining numbers in a way that gets us to 38.\n\nLet's think of a scenario where we can use 76 in a way that it doesn't overshadow the result and we can use 35 appropriately. We can subtract 38 from 76 to get 38, but we need to use 35 and 70. \n\nIf we subtract 38 from 76, we get 38. We need to incorporate 35 and 70. The only way to do this and still get 38 is to use 35 in a way that it doesn't increase the result. The only feasible way is to use 35 in a subtraction or division, but we need to ensure the result is 38. \n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider:\n76 - (70 - 35) = 76 - 35 = 41 (which is not 38)\nWe need to re-evaluate the approach. We should consider the possibility of using 35 not directly but in a way that it can be adjusted.\n\nIf we consider 76 - 38 = 38, and we need to use 35 and 70, we can do:\n76 - (70 - 35) = 76 - 35 = 41 (again not 38)\n\nWe need to look at a simpler approach:\n35 - (76 - 70) = 35 - 6 = 29 (not 38)\n38 - (76 - 70) = 38 - 6 = 32 (not 38)\n\nWe need to find a way to use all numbers:\n(76 / 70) * 35 = 38 (This works as 76 / 70 = ~1.0857 and 1.0857 * 35 = 38)\n\nThus, the equation is:\n<answer> (76 / 70) * 35 </answer>"}]

This simplifies to 64 + 7 = 71, which is also too high.\n\nNow, let's try 64 - 97 = -33, then add 61 and 27: -33 + 61 + 27 = 55. This works.\n\nSo the equation is 64 - 97 + 61 + 27 = 55.\n</think>\n<answer> 64 - 97 + 61 + 27 </answer>"}]

Using 39: Similar to 78, it's larger than 29 and can be used in subtraction or division.\n\nLet's try to use 27 in a way that helps us get to 29. If we add 2 to 27, we get 29.

Trying to use division or subtraction from 72 or 89 might help.\n\nLet's try:\n(89 - 72) + 11 - 12 = 17 + 11 - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16\n\nThis is not 23, so let's try another combination.\n\n(89 - 12) - 72 + 11 = 77 - 72 + 11 = 5 + 11 = 16\n\nThis is still not 23. Let's try one more time.\n\n(89 - 11) - 72 + 12 = 78 - 72 + 12 = 6 + 12 = 18\n\nThis is still not working. Let's try a different approach:\n\n(72 / 12) * 11 - 89 = 6 * 11 - 89 = 66 - 89 = -23\n\nThis is close but negative. Let's try the inverse:\n\n89 - (72 / 12) * 11 = 89 - 6 * 11 = 89 - 66 = 23\n\nThis works!\n\n</think>\n<answer> 89 - (72 / 12) * 11 </answer>"}]

The numbers 39 and 85 are the largest, and their sum is 124, which is more than 55. We can use 85 - 39 to get 46, which is closer to 55.\n\nNow, we need to use the remaining numbers 2 and 18 to reach 55 from 46. If we add 18 to 46, we get 64, which is too much. If we subtract 18 from 46, we get 28, which is too little. If we add 2 to 46, we get 48, which is still too little. If we subtract 2 from 46, we get 44, and then we need 11 more to reach 55. \n\nSince we can only use 2 and 18 once, we need to find a way to use 2 and 18 in a way that will give us the needed 11. We can't use 2 or 18 as they are because they would not get us to 55 directly. However, we can use 18 in a multiplication or division to get a result closer to 11. \n\nLet's try 18 / 2, which is 9.

One approach is to use multiplication and division to get to a number that can be adjusted to 14 with addition or subtraction.\n\nFirst, I notice that 91 is a large number, and if I can get to 14 using the other numbers, it might work well to use 91 as a base.

Adding 80 to 13 would overshoot 14, so I can't use 80. Subtracting 80 from 13 would give me a negative number, which isn't helpful. The only number left is 53, which is too large to help, so I need to think of another way to get to 14.\n\nSince 13 is very close to 14, I can add 1, which I can get from 53 - 52. However, 52 is not one of the numbers, so I should look for another combination.\n\nAnother approach is to use the numbers in a way that one of them can be manipulated to get close to 14. I notice that 80 - 66 = 14, and 66 is 53 + 13, with 13 being 91 / 7.

Let's consider the operations and the possible combinations:\n\n1. Trying to subtract or divide by larger numbers might not give us 47 as the result, so we should consider addition and multiplication as primary operations.\n2. Multiplying 25 by 2 would give us 50, which is close to 47, so we can try to get 3 from the other numbers.\n3. We can use 82 - 38 = 44, and then add 3 to reach 47, but we need to use 28 and 25 in the equation.\n4. If we subtract 3 from 28, we get 25, and then we need to add 22 to get 47. But we don't have 22.\n5. Another approach could be to use multiplication and subtraction: (82 - 28) / 3 + 25 = 54 / 3 + 25 = 18 + 25 = 43 (which is close but not 47).\n6. Let's try using 28 and 25 in a multiplication: (28 - 3) * (25 / 82) is not going to work as 82 in the denominator is not a factor.\n7. The correct approach seems to be: (82 - 28) / 3 + 25 = 54 / 3 + 25 = 18 + 25 = 43, which is close but not 47.\n8. Let's try: (82 - 25) / 3 + 28 = 57 / 3 + 28 = 19 + 28 = 47.\n\nSo the correct equation is (82 - 25) / 3 + 28.\n</think>\n<answer> (82 - 25) / 3 + 28 </answer>"}]
